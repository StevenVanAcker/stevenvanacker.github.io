# My name and how to write it correctly

My name is Steven Van Acker, where "Steven" is my given name and "Van Acker" is my family name. 
"Van" is not my middle name. In fact, I have no middle name.
These ways of writing my name are correct:

* Steven Van Acker
* S. Van Acker
* Van Acker, Steven

And these are wrong:

* S. V. Acker
* S. Acker
* Acker, Steven Van
