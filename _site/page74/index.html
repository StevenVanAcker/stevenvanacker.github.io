    A couple weeks ago, I infected everyone here with a tetrinet addiction. A couple days ago, I started writing an automated player for tetrinet.<br /><br />Tetrinet has (without doubt) the ugliest protocol I've ever seen. It starts out by letting the client register with an obfuscated hexadecimal string that encodes the username and the protocol version. The encryption key is derived from the IP. This all seems sortof pointless to me, since everyone knows the IP of the tetrinet server. Anyway, the rest of the protocol is plaintext and it uses character 0xFF as a termination character (again pretty silly).<br />To add to the uglyness, the protocol puts all the hard work on the client side. The server just seems to forward all messages between the clients. This makes it ideal for cheating, since a player can make up blocks, change other peopl's playingfields and other funky things. <br /><br />After playing with the protocol a bit, I made a player that just spits out new play-fields all the time. I've been able to recreate the animation of a bouncing smiley on my first attempt.<br /><br />Right now, I'm making a perl library so I can make several virtual players, all with their own AI.<br />And there lies the problem. I can't find a good heuristic for the AI. Obviously, the less lines are in the tetris playfield, the better. But the AI should also form completed lines. One of the things I should try, is take the number of "holes" in the playfield into account in the heuristic.<br /><br />It would also be nice if the AI was able to think ahead and (something that I have neglected so far) use some strategy to use the special blocks at the correct time (or at all even, since right now it just ignores them).

    After stripping both main gateways at work a couple weeks ago, I ripped all the hardware from them and assembled a nice desktop machine. I installed Ubuntu on it and everything was great. Birds were singing, the sun was shining and also, I had ice-cream!<br /><br />Tristan wanted to install this game he bought through eBay called Championship Manager (a football manager game) and for that, I needed Windows. After resizing the (9GB SCSI) harddisk to have some free space for Windows, I set out to look for a Windows 98SE CD. The original Windows 98SE CD I had was eaten by my old computer after it elegantly EXPLODED in the CDROM-drive. (Really, we still laugh about how the Windows CD crashed itself even before it was installed).<br /><br />So there I am, on the interweb. My good friend google soon located a Windows98SE ISO, which I downloaded of course. After the terribly slow CD-RW burning is done, I discover that the CD is in fact a copy of a Mexican Windows 98SE.<br /><br />Well, it couldn't be that bad, could it ? Things like "Microsoft Windows" are translated to the same thing in Spanish. "No" and "Si" are also quite understandable. Even things like "Continuar", "Instalar" and other friends are interpretable. However, I must have made a wrong turn somewhere because after rebooting, it appeared my Ubuntu was totally gone.<br />To make matters worse, the game wouldn't run under Windows 98SE (Even a multicultural version like mine! At least the errors were in English that time.)<br /><br />I thought Windows XP would run on my hardware like a fat pig up a hill on a burning summer-day, but it's quite allright.<br />The only thing I miss in this Windows, is a decent movieplayer. I just plain don't like MS Mediaplayer.<br />So I download the player I've always trusted: BSplayer.<br />Installation goes as I expected, except that after I agree to the license, this pops up: "To use BSplayer for free and support our future development you must keep Save! software on your PC".<br /><br />What. The. Hell.<br /><br />"You can remove Save! from your computer at any time in the "Add or Remove Programs" section of the Control Panel. To uninstall Save!, you must also uninstall BSplayer."<br /><br />Et tu, Brute ? BSplayer has succombed to the adware bussiness ??<br /><br />So sad :( The only good mediaplayer out on the internet seems to have beefed itself up with bloat- and adware. Beefcake!<br /><br />Dear Mr. BSpayer author, you have lost all my respect. Not only will I not install your excellent player with the added bloatware and adware cruft, I will find myself a mediaplayer that does all the same things AND without the cruft.<br />My PC is not a place where you can dump your trash and make money of it. kthx.<br />

        the end of the world
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2006</span>

    Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday this week.<br /><br />...<br />I'm not sure what to write anymore.<br />All my energy, inspiration and strength is drained. For the past 2 weeks, I've pushed myself to finish a number of projects that were on my todolist. The results are nice. I setup 5 totally new servers, and replaced 4 others with new hardware.<br /><br />At this very moment, I'm looking at the setup of the last machine. The last item on my todo-list.<br />I could probably finish it today, but I'm overwhelmed by some kind of loss.<br /><br />I planned 7 weeks of holidays, which start in about 8 hours. And I wonder what happens when I finish my todo-list. What's beyond that ridge ?<br /><br />There's a place I come by often, a road which goes over a hill. When I cycle towards it, it looks like I've reached the end of the world. It's a nice view...<br /><br />In many ways, I'll reach the end of the world in 8 hours. Let's hope the view is equally nice.<br /><br /><br />About 3 weeks ago, 2 girls disappeared in the south of Belgium. A couple days ago, they were found: strangled and dumped in a sewer. The preliminary report suggests that at least one of them was raped.<br /><br />I've always believed in a clean and just society, one where people can live happily in peace and everyone is safe. My opinions on freedom, democracy, justice and other aspects of society are very strong and often debated. At this point though, I find my beliefs shattered. Perhaps the perfect society is utopian. Maybe violence and injustice are an integral part of mankind. <br /><br />Unlike in movies, the good guys (and girls) hardly ever win in real life. Good and bad are not in balance. Efforts to fight evil seem so pointless... Personally, I wonder what the harm would be if I just gave up. Maybe I care too much about the bigger view. Maybe I should be like everyone else: live your own life and be happy not knowing about the dirt. How our freedom is being taken away a piece at the time, our democracy is turning into a TV-show and the feeling of security is nanometers away from being a bad joke.<br /><br />Ignorance is bliss.<br />"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war"

    The matrix is [a b c d e f] where (a,b) is the X-vector, (c,d) is the Y-vector, and (e,f) is the position vector.<br /><br />After some playing around I managed to get an image in my postscript file.<br />But just one ...<br />After more experimenting, it seemed that "colorimage" was not able to render the image twice in 1 page.<br /><br />So after a long time of searching, I decided to re-implement the colorimage function and write my own version. It draws every pixel as a box of the correct color.<br />Using that, I was able to put logos on all our labels. The printer took 3 or 4 minutes to render the postscript though (66x 40x40 pixels images)

    I found <a href='http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/postscript/'>this comment</a>:<br /><pre><br />Since in postscript an image is defined from the lower left corner, <br />and the image is defined from its top left corner, the transformation <br />matrix used here does the appropriate vertical flipping.<br /></pre><br /><br />And that's for the matrix [26 0 0 -34 0 34] of a 26x34 image.
