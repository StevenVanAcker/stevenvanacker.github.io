        Agora modules released!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2006</span>

    Ok, so next order of business!<br /><br />Before I talk about the paintball stuff, I have to release the sourcecode for the <a href='http://agora.singularity.be'>agora</a> drupal modules, something I've been putting of for way too long.<br /><br />I decided to release them under the <a href='http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/'>beerware license</a>.<br />So if you like the modules, you can buy me a beer, or even better (since I don't drink any beer, see some blog I made a month or so ago how beer makes you more fat than wine), you can buy me a glass of wine :)<br /><br />The agora modules consist of 3 separate modules: agora, scoring and link. The agora module keeps it's data in a MySQL table, so it has a agora.install file to create that.<br /><br />So what do these modules do ?<br /><br />The agora module uses the <a href='http://drupal.org/project/tac_lite'>tac_lite</a> module to finetune access control for specific taxonomy terms. To link an access role together with a taxonomy term and a password, and all of this by some user who is allowed to create such a tuple, the agora module provides a nice interface to do this. You can enter a name for the role (which is the same name for the taxonomy term) and enter a password. The role is then created. Of course, creating this is not enough. People actually have to be able to activate this role. The agora module also provides an interface for this. That's all it does. The agora module is the only one of the 3 that is probably not general purpose. I wrote is specifically for the agora site.<br /><br />The scoring module allows administrators to assign scores for each content type posted, content posted under certain taxonomy terms, comments attached to certain content types, etc. It provides a nice admin interface to enter the scores and a block to show the Top-10. User scores are calculated on the fly, unlike the <a href='http://drupal.org/project/userpoints'>userpoints</a> module, which keeps that data in some mysql table. <br /><br />Finally, the link module provides a new content type. Users are able to post a link together with a description. There is also an overview page with the last 50 links. There's no more to it.<br /><br />The agora modules can be found <a href='http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/agora/'>here</a>.<br />Have fun with them :)

        this war on terror thing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2006</span>

    I was going to write about the fun I had at the paintball shootingrange today, but I'll do it after this post.<br /><br />Ever since the USA failed to stop 2 planes flying into their prize-towers, they have been waging war against terrorism. According to them, and now the entire global opinion because everyone watches hollywood-journalism, terrorism equals islam and is sponsored by all those countries that drill up oil and sell it to the west.<br /><br />The USA has been sending troops all over the place, making up evidence as they go to prove that their intervention is needed. After invading Afghanistan to hunt down Bin Laden, at which they failed, they focused on Iraq for no apparent reason except that Bush Senior had a bruised ego for not being able to kill Saddam Hussein. While the USA was trying to squeeze in some "democracy" into Iraq (And I put democracy in quotes because I don't believe in enforced democracy), a civil war broke out that demolished the country. And THEN, the USA came crawling back to the UN demanding that a peace-force was established so they could clean up the American mess. I'm suprised the entire UN didn't point at the USA and cry "HAHA, We told you so", but that's a totally other story.<br /><br />Anyway, while the USA was trying hard to make up evidence to convince the world that Iran was infested with terrorists and weapons of mass destruction, the unexpected happened. Israel invaded Libanon !<br />Oh what a slap in the face for the USA. The prodigy child they had been supplying weapons for suddenly went bezerk and attacked their neighbour because 2 soldiers were kidnapped. Ever since then, Israel has been fighting the Hezbollah, killing hundreds of people. The USA, now totally confused because the attention is no longer pointed at them policing the world, is unable to stop this war. Israel no doubt paid a lot of attention to it's guardian parent USA when they thought they could just do anything and blow up half the planet for no good reason. <br /><br />I wonder what's going to happen with all this. Today, some Egyptian terror group declared that they were joining forces with Al Qaeda. So instead of wiping out terrorism in the world, the USA has made things terribly worse.<br /><br />So now I was wondering. If terrorism is sponsored by all those rich countries selling oil, can't we just wipe out terrorism by no longer buying the oil from them ? Someone invent some alternative powersource damnit ! Those rich countries will be third-world countries in a nano-second and the terrorists will no longer have money to buy weapons. End of story, the entire planet wins.<br /><br />Of course, that would not fit well with the USA government because as we all know, the companies in the USA run the government, including companies that actually sell oil.<br /><br />Boy, I would love to see Bush and friends fall flat on their faces. But I don't think it will happen anytime soon...

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2006</span>

    I just came back from the computer store.<br />The shopkeep was very cooperative about trying out Linux on the Gigabyte 6-Quad motherboard. In fact, he called up a friend and asked to test it for me, right there on the spot. Very good service :)<br /><br />His friend didn't have any Linux CD handy though, so the shopkeeper will test it himself tonight.<br />I ordered the rest of my hardware already so I don't have to do all that later on.<br /><br />If Linux works on the 6-Quad, I'll buy it in combination with a core2 duo E6400 processor. In order for me to find it adequate, Linux will have to support at least both SATA controllers and the GBit NIC. The audio would be nice too, but I read that support for it will appear in <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_18">the 2.6.18 kernel</a>.<br /><br />So, in case the 6-Quad fails, I'll have to look out for another motherboard. The one I had in mind (MSI K8N Diamond Plus) would be preferable, were it not that AMD started using a new socket type for it's processors (sAM2) and I will probably have to pick another motherboard for that.<br /><br />The shop has 4 sAM2 motherboards, all from MSI.<br />1 of these is no good since it only has 4 SATA2 connectors.<br />So that leaves me with <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=730">MSI K9N Platinum</a>, <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=729">MSI K9N SLI Platinum</a> and <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=731">MSI K9N Ultra</a>.<br /><br /><table><br /><tr><br />    <th>Mainboard</th><br />    <th>PCI slots</th><br />    <th>PCI-e slots</th><br />    <th>AGP slots</th><br />    <th>SATA ports</th><br />    <th>PATA ports</th><br />    <th>LAN ports</th><br />    <th>video</th><br />    <th>audio</th><br />    <th>Price</th><br /></tr><br /><tr><br />    <td><a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=730">MSI K9N Platinum</a></td><br />    <td>3</td><br />    <td>4</td><br />    <td>0</td><br />    <td>6</td><br />    <td>1</td><br />    <td>2</td><br />    <td></td><br />    <td>X</td><br />    <td>122,50 €</td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br />    <td><a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=729">MSI K9N SLI Platinum</a></td><br />    <td>3</td><br />    <td>4</td><br />    <td>0</td><br />    <td>6</td><br />    <td>1</td><br />    <td>2</td><br />    <td></td><br />    <td>X</td><br />    <td>155,00 €</td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br />    <td><a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=731">MSI K9N Ultra</a></td><br />    <td>3</td><br />    <td>4</td><br />    <td>0</td><br />    <td>6</td><br />    <td>1</td><br />    <td>2</td><br />    <td></td><br />    <td>X</td><br />    <td>99,00 €</td><br /></tr><br /></table><br /><br />All the mainboards look strangely alike. So in case the 6-Quad doesn't work out, I'll go for the cheapest MSI motherboard.<br /><br />On a more positive note, the store had the Hauppauge PVR500 in stock, and I bought it :)

    After yesterday's adventure with taking pictures of my lungs (which prove btw that I did indeed have some kind of lung infection, still visible on the photo's), it was too early to pick up my medication.<br /><br />So I stopped by UPC to finally get that new internet connection I promised myself a long time ago. They will hook me up this tuesday.<br /><br />The new internet connection pushed me to look into the whole fileserver thing again. So I looked up my old notes and compared them to the new prices. The only thing that changed is the processor price. (In fact, the one I had in mind is no longer sold and I'd have to go with an athlon 64 3500+, not a big problem for me)<br /><br />When I got to the computerstore and explained what I wanted, the owner shifted into a 30-minute lecture about the new Intel Core Duo CPU's and how wonderful they are and whatnot. He also showed me a motherboard they had been testing: <a href="http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ClassValue=Motherboard&ProductID=2295&ProductName=GA-965P-DQ6">Gigabyte 6-Quad</a>. I told him I'd look into it, mainly because I didn't want to just buy old crap after such a long time of stalling the purchase.<br /><br />I looked at the <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/07/14/core2_duo_knocks_out_athlon_64/">CPU benchmarks</a> and they are absolutely stunning. The new Core Duo's blow the Athlon 64 out of the sky on every terrain: better performance, much lower power consumption and less heat dissipation.<br /><br />So my mind was already half set to get this new godly piece of silicon (65nm technology vs 90nm btw). <br />My attention shifted to the proposed motherboard. It has 8 (eight) SATA2 connectors, which made me "yippie", onboard sound, enough PCI and PCI-e slots and a very good power supply towards the CPU.<br />I convinced myself that the extra 200 euro would be well spent and that the new fileserver would outperform anything I had in mind before. But then I remembered I want to run linux on it...<br /><br />The motherboard has a <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/products1-2.aspx?modelid=2006072">Realtek ALC888DD chipset</a> which has me worried a bit. Although there is a <a href="ftp://202.65.194.18/pc/hda/alc888/ALC888_DataSheet_1.0.pdf">datasheet</a> for it, which would allow a linux driver, I can't get the <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/products1-2.aspx?modelid=10">Realtek RTL8139 chipset</a> out of my mind which, although cheap, is of terrible design (I had a link to a kerneldriver with comments depicting just how awful this chipset is, but I can't find it... maybe it's <a href="http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~fanf2/hermes/src/grub-e1000/netboot/rtl8139.c">this one</a>)<br /><br />Then I thought about the intel P965 chipset. I actually haven't heard of anyone who was able to run Linux on it. This could be because it's so new of course. The motherboard has 2 SATA controllers: one is the ICH8R chipset (the southbridge) and the other is some Gigabyte thing I never heard of. The ICH8 will probably work in Linux, but I don't know about the Gigabyte SATA2 controller...<br /><br />So before I buy this thing I'll ask the shopkeep if he tried running Linux on it.<br />I've also looked at the alternatives... They have 1: The <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=744">MSI P965 Neo</a> motherboard. It only has 5 SATA2 connectors though, not enough.<br /><br />While looking up this motherboard, I saw another one based on the P965: <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=745">MSI P965 Platinum</a>, which has 7 SATA connectors. The audio chipset is again a realtek one... :(
