        Rant about Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2007</span>

    Ever since I followed the course "User Interfaces", I've been subscribed to Jakob Nielsen's announcement mailinglist (I was required to subscribe and it sometimes has nice alertboxes).<br /><br />Today's alertbox is about<br /><pre><br />Interaction techniques that deviate from common GUI standards <br />can create usability catastrophes that make applications impossible <br />to use.<br /></pre><br /><br />But that's not the problem. The problem is how the email is structured. Let me show you what it looks like:<br /><br /><pre><br />Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox for July 23 is now online at:<br />  &gt; http://www.useit.com/alertbox/dialog-box.html<br /><br />Summary:<br />Interaction techniques that deviate from common GUI standards can create<br />usability catastrophes that make applications impossible to use.<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />User Experience 2007 conference<br /><br />  &gt; Barcelona, November 4-9<br />  &gt; Las Vegas, December 2-7<br /><br />31 full-day tutorials<br />2 keynote presentations: e-commerce, the state of usability<br /><br />Full program:<br />  &gt; http://www.nngroup.com/events<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />CASE STUDIES WANTED: MEASURABLE IMPACT OF DESIGN CHANGES<br /><br />I am collecting examples of metrics that quantify the impact of<br />design changes. If you have data you are willing to share, please<br />email John Berger at metrics@nngroup.com<br /><br />Any type of user interface is of interest: websites, intranets,<br />applications, mobile devices, etc. Also, the design changes may refer to a<br />complete redesign of the total UI or it could just be a single feature,<br />screen, or design element that was changed.<br /><br />Measures of interest include anything that measures how usage changed.<br />That often means an improvement, but data that documents negative results<br />are just as interesting.<br /><br />Example metrics:<br />  * conversion rate<br />  * total e-commerce sales in dollars and/or units<br />  * size of average "sales basket" for e-commerce<br />  * training time needed to learn a feature or system<br />  * sign-up rate for newsletters or other desired action<br />  * lead-generation<br />  * time on task and other productivity measures<br />  * subjective satisfaction scores<br />  * average page views and/or duration of visit per user<br />  * returning visitor traffic<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Notice how all links in this mail are preceded by a "greater than" sign for some odd reason, possibly to indicate that it is a link. Surely the "http://" in front would not have given it away any faster...<br /><br />This "greater than" sign bugs the hell out of me. This is how I read my mail: I open mutt, open a mail and read it. If any interesting links are within it, I double click on the line so it all gets selected (and automagically copied into my copy/paste buffer) and paste it in my browser.<br /><br />Because of the "greater than" sign at the start of the line, I can't just copy the entire line by doubleclicking on it. No, I have to go to the start of the URL, and select the URL untill the end. I hate that.<br /><br />Isn't it ironic that a mailinglist about usability forced me to stray for my normal procedure and forces me to use a more difficult and timeconsuming one ?<br /><br />Dear Jakob Nielsen, please get rid of the stupid "greater than" sign in front of your links and just let the links sit on their own empty line.<br /><br />Cheers!

    I reassembled my frame last saturday, but couldn't upload the pictures untill now because the webserver was down :(<br /><br />[G2:11554]<br /><br />Notice how the frame is bent a little on the left side. I have no idea why that is, but I hope it won't cause any trouble.<br /><br />[Update 20070727]<br />crashmann on the <a href='http://www.tk560.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=4386'>TK560 forums</a> recognizes this as "barrel distortion". It means my frame is not bent after all :)

        disassembled and cut at 45 degree angle

    <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2007</span>

    The loadcarrying planks (carrying the big 102cm squares) of my frame did not fit together inside the metal L profile, so they had to be cut at a 45 degree angle.<br /><br />At first,. I tried using an electric mitre saw, but it did not have enough space underneath to cut the entire plank at once (9cm). The result was this:<br />[G2:11528]<br /><br />That wasn't good at all. After some advice from a friend of mine (Bob), I decided to buy a circular saw that could be tilted at a 45 degree angle. To lock down the planks, I used a bunch of scrap wood screwed to an old wooden work-table that the former tenants of our house left in the basement.<br /><br />[G2:11532]<br /><br />I didn't count on the guide-bar of the circular saw being so short, so had to fix the setup a bit and remount the scrap wood a little.<br /><br />[G2:11535][G2:11538]<br /><br />The result: A nicely cut 45 degree side.<br />[G2:11544]<br />The screwed up plank got fixed this way too:<br />[G2:11541]<br /><br />And now the supporting planks fit nicely together in the frame:<br />[G2:11547][G2:11550]<br /><br />I cut all the planks now, but didn't assemble the entire frame yet. Instead, I took everything apart and will assemble it in the basement. The livingroom (while it's a nice place to work) is not the right place to do this kind of stuff.<br /><br />All pictures:<br />[G2:11526]

    [G2:11476]<br /><br />I assembled the frame for the vacuform machine today. After half an hour measuring, and another half hour drilling, I was ready to assemble everything. As I expected, I was unable to drill the holes straight down, most of them are 5-10 degrees off :(<br />I need to get a column-drill thingy...<br /><br />Also expected: the side-pieces (on which the 102cm squared panels rest) don't fit together nicely in the corners. That's why I bought the planer, and I still need to use it on those side-pieces.
