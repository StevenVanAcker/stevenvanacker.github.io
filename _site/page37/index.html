    <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2007</span>

    Omdat ik in Engeland zat, heb ik er eerste 2 lessen van het jaar gemist. Deze week waren dus mijn eerste 2 lessen van het jaar. Maandag automechanica en dinsdag lassen.<br /><br />Automechanica was best wel gezellig. Het leek meer op een vragenronde dan een echte les, maar dat was misschien de bedoeling. Ik heb alleszins veel bijgeleerd over hoe een motor werkt en hoe banden bvb in mekaar zitten.<br /><br />De les lassen was veel minder theorie. Ik had verwacht om toch iets van achtergrond te horen te krijgen, maar dat was dus niet het geval. Na een half uurtje, waarbij de vorige les overlopen werd in sneltreinvaart, zijn we effectief aan het lassen gegaan. Daar heb ik mij dan direct kunnen uitleven en alle dingen die ge zeker niet moogt doen, aan de lijve ondervinden waarom.<br /><br />Zoals verwacht moet ik voor beide vakken wat materiaal kopen. Geen cursussen, hetgeen voor mij iets nieuws is. Ik ben dan ook geen technische scholing gewoon...<br /><br />Vandaag ben ik in Metaleuven al het materiaal gaan kopen dat ik voor lassen nodig heb: een katoenen werkpak, veiligheidsschoenen, een veiligheidsbrol en een paar leren handschoenen. Dat alles voor 92 euro (inclusief 10% KULeuven korting)<br /><br />Het materiaal voor automechanica kan nik via het VTI bestellen, en dat is ook wat ik ga doen aangezien ik dat materiaal zo goedkoop niet kan krijgen (zelfs met korting)<br /><br />Uit interesse ben ik vandaag ook samen met noot naar de oldtimerbeurs gaan zien in de Brabanthal. Voor 10 euro inkom had ik toch wel iets beter verwacht, maar het was toch wel tof.<br /><br />PS: oh ja, ik heb nu ook weer een studentenkaart ;)

        bridged networking with Virtualbox
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2007</span>

    <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">Virtualbox</a> is a great tool. It looks a lot like VMWare, and has a lot of it's functionality. It seems to runs faster and it's opensource AND it has ubuntu packages.<br /><br />But virtualbox's networksetup sucks. Like VMWare, it allows for network-connections from the guest OS through NAT, which works nicely. But for most of my applications, I need bridged networking between the guest OS and the network adapter of the host OS.<br /><br />Several guides exist on the internet that explain in detail how to do each step. But none of them explain the big red lines.<br /><br />As I found out, it's pretty simple:<br /><ul><br /><li>Create a TAP/TUN device</li><br /><li>Create a bridge between a physical interface (like eth0) and the TAP/TUN device</li><br /><li>Bring all interfaces up</li><br /></ul><br /><br />OK, that's it ! See ? It's not difficult at all.<br /><br />But there is trickery involved to be able to keep using the physical device together with virtualbox. Once you setup the bridge, you will not be able to use the physical device anymore and network connectvity will be lost.<br /><br />Instead of setting an IP address on the physical interface (be it either with DHCP or static), you now need to set this IP on the bridge.<br /><br />To me this all sounds ugly. I use Ubuntu, and I don't want to mess with the networksettings this much because I expect NetworkManager to do that. The solution is to trick NetworkManager into thinking that nothing has changed. And to do that, we pull an old switcheroo on the network devices.<br /><br /><img src="/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=12386"><br /><br />NetworkManager expects eth0 (in my case) to be the interface it needs to configure. But when using Virtualbox, I need to create a bridge (br0) and tell NetworkManager to use that interface instead. I have no idea how NetworkManager works, but I assume it just looks at the devicename. So before NetworkManager starts, I rename eth0 to something else (old-eth0) and createn a bridge called eth0.<br /><br /><img src="/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=12391"><br /><br />This setup works greatly. When I reboot, all devices are set up nicely and I can start Virtualbox and use bridged networkinng. But there is still a problem: NetworkManager is very confused.<br /><br />I'll look into that later on<br /><br />This is the script I use to create tap1 and tap2<br />It should be made executable and linked into the subdirectories of /etc/network (if-down.d, if-post-down.d, if-pre-up.d and if-up.d)<br /><br />Don't give the script an extension like "virtualbox.sh", because it apparently doesn't work that way.<br /><br /><pre><br />#!/bin/bash<br /><br />TAPS="tap1 tap2"<br />MYINTERFACES="eth0"<br /><br />if [ "$IFACE" != "$MYINTERFACES" ];<br />then<br />    exit;<br />fi<br /><br /><br /><br />pre_down() {<br />    # first, remove all setup<br />    for INT in $TAPS; do<br />        echo "# switching off $INT"<br />        ifconfig $INT down<br />        echo "# removing $INT from bridge"<br />        brctl delif $IFACE $INT<br />        echo "# removing $INT alltogether"<br />        tunctl -d $INT<br />    done<br />}<br /><br />post_down() {<br />    echo "# bringing down the physical interface"<br />    ifconfig old-$IFACE down<br />    echo "# removing the physical interface from the bridge"<br />    brctl delif $IFACE old-$IFACE<br />    echo "# deleting the bridge $IFACE"<br />    brctl delbr $IFACE<br />    echo "# renaming the physical interface old-$IFACE back to $IFACE"<br />    ip link set old-$IFACE name $IFACE<br />}<br /><br />pre_up() {<br />    echo "# renaming $IFACE to old-$IFACE"<br />    ip link set $IFACE name old-$IFACE<br />    echo "# setting up $IFACE to be a bridge"<br />    brctl addbr $IFACE<br />    echo "# adding old-$IFACE to the bridge $IFACE"<br />    brctl addif $IFACE old-$IFACE<br />    echo "# bringing up the physical interface"<br />    ifconfig old-$IFACE up<br />}<br /><br />post_up() {<br />    # setting up the tun devices<br />    for INT in $TAPS; do<br />        echo "# creating $INT"<br />        tunctl -t $INT -u deepstar<br />    done<br />    <br />    chown root.vboxusers /dev/net/tun<br />    <br />    for INT in $TAPS; do<br />        echo "# adding $INT to bridge"<br />        brctl addif $IFACE $INT<br />        echo "# switching on $INT"<br />        ifconfig $INT up<br />    done<br />}<br /><br /><br />case $PHASE in <br />    pre-up)<br />        pre_up<br />        ;;<br />    post-down)<br />        post_down<br />        ;;<br />    post-up)<br />        post_up<br />        ;;<br />    pre-down)<br />        pre_down<br />        ;;<br />esac<br /></pre>

        5 pounds and no hug

    Linux Conference is not all about techie stuff. Once the talks are over, it's time to eat and go home.<br /><br />So, tuesday evening we were looking for dinner at a store (Sainsbury Central or so) when suddenly the alarm goes off. I saw some people running away from the store and it was clear that they robbed something.<br /><br />So when we got outside, the robber was already caught by the police, not even 10 meters outside of the door. The guy had stolen 4 bottles of expensive champagne, probably not to drink them. 2 police officers were on top of him holding him down.<br /><br />Anyway, life goes on right ? So we walked down the street to go to the Subway sandwich bar a bit further. Around the corner come 2 patrol cars and a police van at high speed (probably around 90 or 100km/h) driving towards the other 2 policemen.<br /><br />This is all new to me. First of all, I have never seen policemen in action inn Belgium. And it's not like we have no crime or anything. Maybe this was a lucky strike and maybe Belgian police also reacts this fast. But still... the police caught this robber redhanded and only 10 meters outside of the store, with a huge display of police-force.<br /><br />It got me thinking about how poverty exists in other countries aswell (obviously)...<br /><br />When we got out of the Subway sandwich bar, a guy and a girl came to me and asked if they could have some money for food. They looked like they could use it. So I grabbed my wallet, and gave them all the change I had in my wallet.<br />Which, for some reason, was quite a lot. I believe it was 5 or 6 pounds. They were very happy. The girl said she would hug me, but "he's my boyfriend".<br /><br />So, no hugs for me :(

    Not much interesting talks on tuesday, except for 2 I didn't want to miss.<br />During the day, a lot of important people showed up because the Linux Kernel Summit will start tomorrow. I recognized Alan Cox right away, and Linux Torvalds arrived some time later on.<br /><br />It's nice how these people don't assume they're better than everyone else :) They just stayed around in the lobby, talking to whomever wanted to and posing for pictures with everyone.<br /><br />Anyway, the talks (both in the afternoon):<br /><br /><b>A Gentle Introduction to Software Defined Radio - Bdale Garbee (HP / Debian)</b><br /><br />This talk was about software defined radio using almost no hardware. The idea is to push all analog parts of a radio out of the design as much as possible, and replace them by digital "blocks" which can be implemented as software on a computer. I should read up on this because it looks really interesting. Being able to listen to any digital signal (like GPS, radar, DVB-T, ...) without having to buy specific hardware for it, sounds very appealing.<br /><br /><b>How to Manage Patches with Git - James Bottomley (Steeleye)</b><br /><br />About the birth and functioning of Git. Git is the source control system of the Linux kernel. Unlike systems like CVS or subversion, Git doesn't work with differences between files, but just stores the entire kernel tree as a single node in the versioning tree. To avoid needing a huge disks to store everything, the system is very optimised to avoid duplicate files and such, and uses compression techniques on nearly-equal files to save a lot of space.<br /><br />After this talk, there was a Git BOF which Linus himself would lead. But I still have no idea what BOF is ;) Maybe some brainstorm session ?

    <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2007</span>

    The afternoon started with 3 talks about filesystems. I sat in all 3 of them, because I had a nice seat and didn't want to give it up ;)<br /><br /><b>The VFS and cluster filesystems - Steven Whitehouse (Red Hat)</b><br /><b>Hard disks are dead. Now what? - Jörn Engel (logfs.org)</b><br /><b>Btrfs -- a new copy on write filesystem - Chris Mason (Oracle)</b><br /><br />None of these talks were of particular interest to me, so I didn't pay much attention. Instead, I tried to work on HPPC a bit, but after failing to write even the most basic code, I gave up on that quickly.<br /><br /><b>How to not invent kernel interfaces - Arnd Bergmann</b><br />This talk was more like what I wanted. Some insight into how the kernel works, specifically which interfaces exist between kernel-space and user-space and which one should be used. Surprisingly, the speaker advises to avoid using any of the current interfaces unless it's absolutely necessary. Instead of there being a single good solution, there are just varying degrees of disadvantages.<br /><br />The talk itself was very lively and interesting, but I wished some of the developers should just keep their comments to theirself (or the mailinglist) instead of crying them out in the middle of a talk. <br /><br /><b>How to work with the kernel development process - Jonathan Corbet (LWN.net)</b><br />Jonathan Corbet is turning out to be one of my favorite speakers at this conference. This is again a talk by him, about how the kernel development process works and how one should interact with it. The main lessons to learn is "release early" and "let everyone know what you're doing". I need to work on both of those, because I tend to keep my code locked up for a long time before releasing it (if I even release it).<br /><br />I will mail the netfilter maintainers about HPPC soon, and let them know what I plan to do with HPPC.<br /><br />By the way, I advise everyone who is serious about wanting to enter the kernel development arena to read the paper on which this talk is based.<br /><br /><br /><b>Duxford</b><br />Duxford is the Imperial War Museum and we were invited for a guided tour there. There were 3 tours: the American hangar which contains lots of planes from the American military (including the Blackbird), the airspace hangar which has contemporary airplanes (also the Concorde) and the land warfare hall, where tanks and the like are located.<br /><br />I followed the land warfare hall with the idea that, because my colleague wanted to follow the american hangar tour, he would take plenty of pictures that I could use aswell. But we not only managed to get a full tour of the land warefare hall in time, there was also time left to quickly run through the american hangar.<br /><br />So I have pictures of both.<br /><br />I won't discuss these pictures, because there are too much of them. Just look at the pictures and the movies :)<br /><br />[G2:12084][G2:12083]
