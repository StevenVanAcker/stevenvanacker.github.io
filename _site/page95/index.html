        Lanparty is coming
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2005</span>

    I did a lot of stuff for the lanparty today. (BANG is organising a lanparty on 4 and 5 november 2005, more information on <a href='http://test.singularity.be'>http://test.singularity.be</a>)<br /><br />I got the projector, paid the deposit for the rooms we hired (372 euros in total), got me a GBIC and created the rules for the lanparty (shamelessly ripped from <a href='http://www.occ.be'>OCC</a>)<br />We also moved the fridge and the gameserver with some help from a colleague.<br /><br />The plan is to print the lanparty rules on an A3 paper and put them on the walls at the lanparty.<br />Ever tried to print a LaTeX document on an A3 paper ? I didn't get it to work, but then again I cheated. I created a postscript file and printed it 2 pages on 1 sheet. Then I tried to print it on A3, which failed for some reason.<br />Oh well :)<br /><br />Just got back from the pub now. I had an interesting talk about all kinds of things. Stuff like project management, the beauty of mathematics and science, true ingenuity, Voronoi diagrams, graphics hardware and FPGA's.<br /><br />And then the DJ decided to screw up the evening by playing his crappy music so loud that we couldn't hear eachother anymore. What is it with pubs these days ? It's like they're all involved in a contest to play the loudest possible music ?<br />When I go to a pub, its not to sit there, drink something and shut up. I go to a pub to have interesting conversations, which means the music in the background stays IN THE BACKGROUND. The last pub on this side of the planet where it's actually nice enough to make conversation it now infested with the same disease as all other pubs I've been to so far :(<br /><br />Anyway, among other things I wonder if there are any studies about people in impossible situations. More specifically, I wonder how people react when they are forced into a position where they have to solve an unsolveable problem, and are forced to try and force it even when they know (either conciously or subconciously) that it is impossible.<br />I imagine most people would get annoyed, but how do they deal with this ? Do they show violence ? Do they crack and collapse ?<br /><br />If I didn't have so many things going on, I would research it. Right now, I have to finish a couple of projects (sogld and SDS: Steven's Driving School). After those projects, I might set up a computer/electronics lab and experiment with (among other things) FPGA's

        700 euros for new glasses
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2005</span>

    The local student restaurants (called ALMA) have a discount for students and personnel. Actually, it's not really a discount: If you can't show your student-card or personnel-card, you have to pay extra.<br /><br />Since I've moved to this new house, which happens to be about 50 meters away from an ALMA restaurant, I've started going there more often. The food is ok, its cheap and its easy.<br /><br />Today was another story. We planned a day of shopping, and would start that day with lunch at ALMA.<br />"Are you a student ?" asked the cashier<br />"No, but I'm personnel" I said, while showing my card and expecting the same discount as the students (something that has always been the rule I believe)<br />"That doesn't count today"<br /><br />What the hell!?<br />Well, no big deal :) It's not like I'm poor, but I did happen to have almost no cash on me...<br /><br />After lunch, we set out to look for new glasses for me. The pair I have now are at least 10 years old. In the 3 stores we visited, I think I tried on every model they had. I did find a nice model, but I'm not sure if I want to buy it yet... The frame itself costs 312 euro, while a single glass costs 180 euros.<br />That's crazy! I wonder how my parents ever managed to pay for all this?<br />The lady behind the counter of the last store noticed that my current glasses were broken and fixed them for me. Free of charge! It's nice to know there are still friendly and helpful people out there. (The store is Optiek Nathalie Bladt, Mechelsestraat 44, 3000 Leuven and it apparently has <a href='http://www.nathaliebladt.com'>a website</a>)<br /><br /><br /><br />Since I had nothing planned for the rest of the day, I joined my friend when she went to buy some clothes.<br />...<br />...<br />THANK GOD FOR STORES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOORD OF CLOTHING SHOPS<br /><br />I don't understand why women take so long to pick some clothes to buy (but I'm glad they do, since they look splendid most of the time :) )<br /><br />Other things done today: washed some kitchentowels, fixed my bike and went to drink something without any cash on me<br /><br />I've often wished that my life was more eventful, but when I write things down like this, plenty of things are already happening in my life :)<br />It was once again a nice day, mainly due to my excellent company

    Not that I'm not grateful for the module, but I don't like the images. Way too small. Someone import the MSN smileys or something :)<br /><br />It would also be nice if you could select a smileys-set to use. That way I could select the right smileys for each holiday, like halloween ;)<br /><br />Maybe if I have lots of time, I can look into this

    I went nuts and installed a whole bunch of drupal modules in the hope it would allow me to upload pictures in batch. Right now I installed folksonomy, album, img_assist and smileys :)<br /><br />So far,no luck though :(

        Image module working

    <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2005</span>

    It seems like the image module is working. It should be noted that Debian uses Drupal 4.5.5 (at this time) and thus you need 4.5.x modules from the drupal site.<br /><br />The module seems to require a lot of configuring which is a bad thing imho.<br />It has lots of settings and they are not structured in categories. This makes it hard to get an overview about what is important and what isn't, when first setting up the image module.<br /><br />I hope to be able to upload some pictures soon. When this works, I will start migrating all my old image galleries to drupal (all 3GB of them)<br /><br />For now, its time for bed :)
