        cheap plastic, where art thou ?!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2006</span>

    I've been trying to melt plastic for a while now. The first attempt was not a success because my oven couldn't get hot enough to melt PET (260+ degrees C)<br /><br />The second attempt was on my barbecue, which did get the PET to melt, but when it cooled down, the plastic became more fragile than I thought. It was more or less like suplho plastics, just a bit harder.<br /><br />Anyway, so far nothing good came from this project.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.goedjn.com/essays/botplas.html">A fellow amateur researcher</a> like me came to the same conclusion. He believes it's more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />So... what do I do next ?<br /><br />I was wondering how carmodel builders make their parts. It appears a lot of them are lazy bastards who just buy parts in the store. But some of them do build chassis and things from scratch. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_building">scratch building</a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't answer the question of how to make your own plastic.<br /><br />After digging a little deeper, I found <a href="http://digg.com/hardware/Mold_your_own_plastic_parts_for_projects_using_hot_water_">this page on digg.com</a> which showed me that I'm not the only one trying to make plastic stuff on the cheap.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.micsaund.com/2006/03/13/plastic-you-can-mold-in-your-home-for-diy-projects/">The page mentioned something called Shapelock</a>, but it seems to be very expensive (500 grams for 30 dollars ?!)<br /><br />Another thing called "Friendly plastic" is also mentioned. After some research, it seems the company that made this material quit somewhere in the 80s.<br /><br />In any case, both shapelock and friendly plastic melt in hot water. Sure, it's nice to play with, but practically unusable as a construction material.<br /><br />And then there is this:<br /><br /><pre><br />For my fellow cheapskates - ...<br /></pre><br />(That's me)<br /><pre>...I know you are out there - I will share my <br />ghetto-fabulous method for molding scavenged plastic. <br />ABS plastic dissolves in acetone! Get a good thick <br />piece (television/CRT housing, motorcycle fairing, <br />etc.), and make a pile of shavings by repeatedly <br />drilling holes in it. When you get a good amount, dump <br />them into a small disposable container with a bit of <br />acetone. Stir until gooey. Remove the blob and mold. It <br />will take at least 24 hours to fully cure, so be <br />patient. Also, air bubbles inevitably get into the mix, <br />making this recycled ABS weaker than original. But it <br />wonâ€™t melt at 160 degrees, either.<br />This stuff gets really sticky when molding! It is <br />manageable though, if you keep your fingertips wet with <br />acetone.<br />This method can be used to repair cracks in a <br />motorcycle fairing!<br /></pre><br /><br />This sounds reasonable. ABS plastic and acetone. If only now I could find out what's made of ABS and where to get large quantities of it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.crclarke.com/Support/pdf/thermo.pdf">here</a> is a PDF with some properties of all kinds of plastics.<br /><br />[A couple hours later]<br /><br />The ABS recycling symbol looks like this:<br /><img src="http://www.earthodyssey.com/imagesRecycle/abs.gif"><br /><br />I looked around and found that the remote control of my TV is made from ABS, aswell as the cassette holder of the cassette deck that was in my car.<br /><br />Furthermore, I found lots more information about solving ABS in acetone here:<br /><a href="http://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=45050">http://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=45050</a><br /><br />I will quote it here in case the site goes down or internet explodes:<br /><br />1:<br /><br /><cite><br />I have been planning my carputer for a LOOOOOOOOOOONG time now and have just been to lazy to get started... well, tonight I started my fabrication and was wondering why more people don't use solvents and solvent adhesives instead of the usual bondo, fiberglass and whatnot... <br /><br />Basically, I took my Xenarc front housing, gutted it, sanded the paint off it, cut my dash so the housing fit nicely in place, sanded the paint and finish off of it... then I mixed chunks of ABS plastic in a condiment bottle with Acetone (MEK works too) to make an ABS sludge. I slipped the housing into place, used masking tape to close off the holes in the rear where the housing and dash meet together, and then squirted my ABS sludge into the gaps and space. I expect the plastic will cure by tomorrow afternoon at which time I can do a prelimiary grinding and sanding and then put more of the sludge in the low spots. It should only take a couple apps and it will be done. <br /><br />With the solvent adhesives, you are chemically bonding the two parts together so there is no chance of it cracking apart whereas over time, bondo will eventually crack (I have experienced this plenty!)... so I'm wondering why more people don't use these solvents instead of bondo. IMO, its even less of a mess as well as a more permanent solution. And don't get my wrong, I'm not hacking on the many people who choose fiberglass and bondo as their medium... just curious. <br /><br />BTW, I'll post picture in the next day or two of my dash work... <br /><br />TTYL!<br /></cite><br /><br />2:<br /><br /><cite><br />Unfortunately, I didn't take pictures of the steps I've taken so far... can't find the ole digital camera! The steps are pretty easy to do by following directions though... as I mentioned previously, I used Acetone but the better chemical for this process is MEK (Methyl Ethyl Ketone)... unfortunately, my local Lowe's didn't have that so I went with Acetone.<br /><br />To make the ABS paste, you need to mix ABS shavings or chunks in a condiment squirt bottle. I purchased my condiment bottles at Walmart in a three bottle set for about $1... came with one yellow, one red, and one clear (mustard, ketsup, and oil/vinegar I guess)... the type of pastic they are made of is stable with Acetone and MEK so all is good. The smaller your ABS shavings are the better but I didn't want to trash my garage or house, so I just broke some ABS into small chunks (1/4" x 1/4")... but for better/easier work on the mix, either use a drill to make shavings or run the ABS through a router... the router works the best. Now put your shavings into the condiment bottle... lots and lots of shavings... once you add a little solvent, the plastic will condense down quite a bit... you will most likely have to add shavings several times... once you have a decent amount (full bottle), make sure your cap is on tight and shake it up... there you have it... ABS paste...<br /><br />As long as you have the bottle capped off good, the solvent can't evaporate out so it will remain as a paste... leave the cap off, the solvent evaporates and you then have a chunk of ABS...<br /><br />The preparation of the plastics to be mated together is the most important part of the process. You MUST sand through all paints on the plastic so that you are working with exposed, virgin plastic. The solvents and paste will pretty much melt the plastic of your monitor housing and your dash panel to create one piece. If you still have paint on the plastic, you aren't doing anything worthwhile. The Acetone might penetrate the paint or finish but it could easy come apart later on. My suggestion is the be sure to sand down to bare plastic... no less!<br /><br />If you've ever used PVC and PVC glue, you know how quickly this bond takes place. The thinner the paste is put on, the quicker it bonds. In the case of PVC pipe and couplings, you have a tight fit as it is... when you put the glue on the pieces and slip them together, they almost instantly stick. In the case of my dash, I poured the paste on pretty heavy so it is taking a little longer to set up... but rest assured, it will be solid soon. About half of my area that was glued was just a touch of glue... it is already hard as a rock... the other half, I poured the paste on about 1/2" thick so it takes longer to solidify... the thicker areas will also shrink up more as it hardens... but I expect to make one if not two more apps before done.<br /><br />I have found my digital camera but am charging batteries as we speak. I'll take some pictures late tonight and post them. I apologize for not taking pictures of the steps up until now though. I can find something else to mock up possibly to show the process... or maybe just find some scrap plastic to glue together to show the strength and abilities. <br /><br />Check back later tonight... I'll post back ASAP. Later!<br /><br />Randy<br /></cite><br /><br />3:<br /><br /><cite><br />BTW, I started writing my reply this morning and finished it once I got home from work a bit ago... I just read the replies and questions and will do my best to answer the questions... <br /><br />First off, the Acetone (or MEK) isn't being used to glue anything together... it is merely melting the plastic to a liquid. When you squeeze the paste onto or into parts, it will both form to fill the voids and ALSO the solvent within the paste will soften the parts that it touches and cause them to basically melt together. <br /><br />Yes, this is similar to plumbing glues... I think if you read the ingredients on a can of ABS or PVC glue, you will find that it has either acetone and/or MEK... along with other solvents. There are different solvents that work better with different kinds of plastics. Another solvent that I have used before is THF (Tetrahydrofuran)... it works well with PVC, ABS, and Sintra (another plastic I have used... poly vinyl material I think)... but the latter costs about $40-$50 per gallon and is hard to come by... MEK from what I recall is about half that price... around $25 per gallon... and acetone isn't the absolute ideal solvent (but works well) is about half again of MEK at around $12 or so per gallon.<br /><br />Anyway, your paste will be the color of the material you disolve in the solvent... so if you have panels that are molded in color, you can use scraps of it to make matching paste... unfortunately, most manufacturers mold parts in black and then add a paint or other finish to that... I think this keeps their cost down because it costs more money for plastics to be ordered in specific colors... I know this because I used to deal with some vacuum forming of ABS and it was gonna cost me an arm and a leg to get the right color ABS sheets to make my parts match the interior of the vehicles I was working with... so it came down to the manufacturers deal... mold in black... custom paint to match. <br /><br />Someone metioned using Acetone to remove adhesives from plastic surfaces without any trouble... be careful... it will most definitely mess things up... if you don't believe me, take a drop of acetone, put it in an unobscure place on the surface and let it sit for a minute or so... then wipe it dry and feel how tacky the surface feels for a moment... you may not notice it at first touch, but the plastic is softened... and if there is any texture, you can easily wipe the texture and cause it to look bad... on the same note, you'll see that when you pour the paste over a surface in a thinner solution (more solvent to plastic ratio), once it hardens, it will have a very smooth, high gloss sheen... it is because the plastic has had a chance to level out... if you leave a large drop of solvent on a hair-cell (texture of lots of vacuum formed pastics) plastic, come back later and you'll have a smooth spot... this is because the plastic melts, levels itself off, and then hardens... <br /><br />The problem with bondo and fiberglass and resins is that they all shrink and expand at a different rate than that of the pastic you are trying to molde together... the thinner you put the bondo/fiberglass on, the less chance of cracking... but in the hostile enviroment of the automotive world, you often have temperature ranges from below freezing all the way up to temperatures that will nearly melt the pastics you are trying to work on and molde together. You are less likely to have problems if the materials expand and contract at the same rate... but again, with the chemical bond you end up with, it is almost impossible to crack... especially if your preparation process gets ALL paint and impurities out of the way... essentially what you have in the end is ONE piece of plastic... not two peices glued together but a dissimilar glue.<br /><br />You can use this process for small gaps or large gaps... the larger gaps are better to be filled with a thicker mixture... for two reasons... 1) becuase the paste is less likely to find gaps to ooze out of... and 2) so it will set up faster. When filling smaller gaps, you can use a thick or thin mixture... if you are trying to fill pits and fine pin-holes, you should use a very thin solution... sometimes you can even just use a brush with acetone or other solvent to soften the surface and make it flow smooth.<br /><br />OK, I've rambled on enough... I'll post more later as I think of it... and I'll post a picture or two once my batteries are charged... TTYL!<br /><br />Coach<br /></cite><br /><br />4:<br /><br /><cite><br />Quote:Originally Posted by Scouse Monkey <br />YOu want to be careful though as the vapours given off when the acetone evaporates fromy our slurry will be harmful and explosive.<br /><br /><br />Yeah... what he said... always keep in mind when working with solvents and other chemicals to work in a well ventilated area... the one chemical I mentioned above (THF) is kinda hard to get hold of due to its dangerous properties... if you read the MSDS (material saftey data sheets)... they almost all tell you that they can be flamable or explosive in high concentration and in the case of THF, it has been proven in a lab to cause or increase the chance for certain cancers! DOH! You should always use rubber gloves when working with solvents... they can soak directly into your skin... ok, enough scary stuff... its really not that bad... just use common sense if you have it! lol<br /><br />Later!<br /><br />Randy<br /></cite>

    I spent yesterday sitting and avoiding to stand up or walk around. During that time, I looked up a couple things on blisters and hiking.<br /><br />These links will come in handy next year:<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blisters">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blisters</a><br /><a href="http://www.vonhof.typepad.com/happy_feet/">http://www.vonhof.typepad.com/happy_feet/</a><br /><a href="http://www.backpack45.com/pct.html">http://www.backpack45.com/pct.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_1065_avoid-getting-blisters.html">http://www.ehow.com/how_1065_avoid-getting-blisters.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.outdoorwomen.ca/section/tips/tips.htm">http://www.outdoorwomen.ca/section/tips/tips.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.nutricraze.com/Article_about_Hiking-tips-the-art-of-avoiding-blisters-and-injuries-a-3871.html">http://www.nutricraze.com/Article_about_Hiking-tips-the-art-of-avoiding-blisters-and-injuries-a-3871.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.hikingdude.com/hiking-blisters.shtml">http://www.hikingdude.com/hiking-blisters.shtml</a><br /><a href="http://smart-hiking.info/category/good-hiking-socks/">http://smart-hiking.info/category/good-hiking-socks/</a><br /><a href="http://www.suslik.org/Writings/hikeaid.html">http://www.suslik.org/Writings/hikeaid.html</a>

    About a week ago, after noot made his <a href='http://www.hackcanada.com/homegrown/wetware/brainwave/index.html'>brainwave machine</a>, I was talking about the things I saw at 22c3 and the <a href='http://www.blinkenlights.de/'>blinkenlights</a> projects. About how I wanted to make a led panel and control it through my computer.<br /><br />Noot then said he has such a panel at home, from a cigarette commercial at his father's store. So he brought it over.<br /><br />[I so much need to buy me a new digital camera to take pictures...]<br /><br />The led panel is mounted inside a metal box. It connects to a standard power outlet and has 3 buttons to control what appears on the screen. The box has 2 led panels actually: front and back. After getting the metal box off, I found that there are 4 identical led panels inside (2 front, 2 back) with a total of 2048 leds. Inside, there is also a motherboards with lots of ICs.<br /><br />Each of the panels is filled with leds, but oddly, not much other components are on the panel. The panels are interconnected with a 10-wide IDC cable-ribbon. Power is supplied by another pair of cables running to each board.<br /><br />After disconnecting and taking out one of the panels, I noticed that the leds are controlled in groups of 4 (arranged in a square). Each panel has 16x32 leds, but 8x16 pixels. Still, good enough to play with.<br /><br />Since the panel consisted of 8 rows of pixels, I theorised that 8 of the IDC cable-ribbon cables carried serial data, while the 2 other probably were ground and clock-signal. I wasn't far off...<br /><br />At first glance, I discovered 2 components that were not resistor ladders and capacitors: <a href='http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/1536.htm'>ST ULN2803A</a> and <a href='http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/8024/m74hc244.htm'>M74HC244B1</a>. The former is an IC with 8 darlington transistors. The latter is a "OCTAL BUS BUFFER WITH 3 STATE OUTPUTS".<br /><br />That looked pretty scary, because neither of these actually seem to do anything useful (in a functional way).<br /><br />The theory now was that the pixels were lid up one at the time and that it happened so fast, the eye saw all leds lighting up at once.<br /><br />So I whipped out an oscilloscope and (first learned how to use it using <a href=' http://www.doctronics.co.uk/scope.htm#what'>this page</a>) started looking for a block-wave that indicated a signal.<br /><br />Of course, I was working blind. I had no idea what pins of which IC was doing whatever. I discovered a couple block-waves, but no modulation on it.<br /><br />So I took out one of the panels and took a closer look at it. The panel is subdivided in 2 regions that are identical (so 8x8 pixels). The IDC connector had pathways coming from it that went directly into the first column of 8 identical ICs. But those were not the M74HC244B1 IC's I thought they were. They were <a href='http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/1989/m74hc595.htm'>M74HC595B1</a> ICs: 8-bit shift register with storage and tristate output latches.<br /><br />That was the missing component!<br />I set down with a multimeter and drew a map of the PCB. Each row of the panel (well, actually half of it) was connected to a shift register. The first 8 pins of the IDC connector were in turn connected to the shift register serial-in pin of each row. The remaining 2 pins were not ground and clock signal as I thought. They are shift register clock and storage register clock. After setting a signal on the data-line (serial-in), the clock on the shift register clock line is raised and the shift register remembers the value. Then, after 8 shifts, the register is filled. Then the storage register clock is raised and all 8 registers are transferred to the storage registers. These storage registers are what control the leds.<br /><br />What I need now, is to test this theory. When <a href='http://www.aitec.be/'>AITEC</a> opens tomorrow, I will buy a 20-pin male IDC connector, a block with 8 dipswitches (for the datalines), 2 push buttons and an empty PCB. And I will try to program the leds manually.<br /><br />If it works, I can hook up the panel to a parallel port and control it through my computer. I plan to write a kernel driver for it, to control the panel in both a text-mode and graphical mode.<br /><br />I already have plans to program a game of tetris on it :) Maybe with an FPGA...<br />

    <a href="http://www.dodentocht.be"><img src="http://www.dodentocht.be/images/doodskop.gif"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.dodentocht.be/">De dodentocht</a> (Deathmarch) is a 100km walk in the Antwerp province. For a couple years, I've wanted to participate but never actually did it. Untill yesterday.<br /><br />As usual in Belgium, it was raining yesterday (friday 12 august 2006). I packed a lot of stuff in my backpack, most of it wasn't needed:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>3 pairs of socks</li><br /><li>a fluorescent jacket for walking at night</li><br /><li>a 2-liter water bottle</li><br /><li>3 cans of Rodeo energydrink (Redbull knock-off) to stay awake at night</li><br /><li>10 packs of tissues because I expected to get a cold</li><br /><li>2 packs of "studentcookies" (10x10cm cookies)</li><br /><li>a white-led flashlight with windable dynamo to charge the battery</li><br /><li>my medication... I'm still on antibiotics :)</li><br /><li>5m of blister-prevention tape</li><br /><li>2 towels in case I got soaked</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Most of this, except for the bottle of water and the cans of energydrink, were packed in a garbage bag (a trick I picked up in highschool when we went hiking) to keep it from getting soaked in heavy rain.<br /><br />I left around 3PM, under heavy rain and halfway to spie's place I noticed I was wearing the wrong shoes.<br />So I went back and decided I'd try my sportsshoes. In retrospect this was a very bad idea. I should have worn my hiking shoes.<br /><br />Anyway, arriving at spie's place, I played with the idea of not going through with it because of the rain. But this thing happens only once every year, and I'd be damned to miss it again.<br />So we left (on foot) for the trainstation. Underway I bought an umbrella which was a very very good purchase.<br />I believe we arrived in Bornem around 5PM, with plenty of time left to register. There was noone in the waiting queue so we got out very quick. The march didn't start untill 9PM, so we hung around a while, eating sandwiches and hamburgers, and having a coffee in a pub.<br />Around 8, we left for the starting-line and we waited. At that time, I thought the wait was the worst part, but I know better now. The sky had cleared up and the organisation said we were looking at clear sky. That was nice to hear :)<br /><br />The first 10 kilometers sucked pretty badly, because we were walking so close together. It got even worse when the weather changed and it started to rain. After about 16 kilometers, we were back in Bornem (The first 16km is a loop) and the group started to expand a bit giving everyone extra space.<br /><br />After 30 kilometers, we were at the Ruisbroek checkpoint and we decided to change socks. We both had blisters at this point (not unexpected because of the rain) and taped them up. I had about 5 blisters.<br /><br />It's strange to be able to talk about 30 kilometers of the march in just 2 paragraphs. The walk between checkpoints seemed endless. 2 checkpoints back we got something to eat and an energydrink (which btw was very good ! Extran Energy). From then on, we got drinks and food along the way at more or less regular intervals. Water, coffee, apples, ...<br /><br />It was now 2.43AM and we had been walking for almost 6 hours straight. The small break we took to take care of blisters did more bad than good. We had dry feet, but our muscles hurt more than ever. <br /><br />At this point we had planned to get atleast to the Palm checkpoint, located at a nice 53.34km from the startline. According to the map, the next checkpoint would be about 3 or 4 kilometers ahead. The odd thing about this checkpoint is that it was mentioned on the map they handed out to us, but it didn't have a name.<br />I can see now that the map on the site doesn't mention this checkpoint and that the next checkpoint we would encounter, was the Duvel checkpoint in Breendonk, at 39.53km. It may be only 9 kilometers, be when your feet hurt, 9 kilometers is a walk through hell. At normal walking speed (6km/h), it would take 1.30 hours. It took us a little more than that. <br /><br /><img src="http://inschrijving.dodentocht.be/tracking/images/route03.gif"><br /><br />We were not tired, thirsty or hungry. Our muscles didn't hurt. Not even the blisters could bother us. But out feet were killing us. It's like walking around with nails up your feet. Every step made it worse. When we were about 1km from the checkpoint, I remembered thinking that was 2000 steps (well, when your feet hurt, a step is not 1 meter :). I tried to picture myself on a running track, which is 400 meters, and then tried to see how far we had to go to have walked 100 meters. When we got there, I was looking at where the next 100m would take us. It was terrible.<br /><br />When the Duvel checkpoint was in sight, I practically dragged myself to it. Being the sadists the organisators apparently were, they had rerouted the track about 50 meters before the checkpoint, and guided us on some courtyard where we could get cake and drinks. All we were interested in now was to have our badge scanned. The food was no temptation. Neither were the drinks. Even more sadistically, the checkpoint was still about 500 or 600 meters away. When we got there and had our badge scanned, we stopped.<br /><br />We still had to walk about 2km to get to the pickup point (Spie's father came to pick us up and I was invited to sleep at his place, something I was very grateful to accept)<br /><br />We had now walked for 7:30 hours and I was happy to sit in a car. I dragged myself upstairs (at this point, my knee-joints aswell as my muscles were very unflexible) and got into bed. It took hours before my feet stopped hurting. But I finally fell asleep. When I got up, the pain was mostly gone.<br /><br />I'm still having trouble to stand up and walk around (or walk up the stairs), but I can relativate: it's nothing compared to 40km on blisters.<br /><br />Although my feet hurt terribly bad and I only made it to the first 40km, I can say this: I made it through the first 40 km.<br /><br />Before the march, I couldn't imagine the pain I would get myself into. There was no cheering crowd at the checkpoint, no medals or certificates. There was just us. And that was more than enough.<br /><br />These are our track records:<br /><a href="http://inschrijving.dodentocht.be/tracking/Default.aspx?s=8528">Peter Spiessens (8528)</a>, <a href="http://inschrijving.dodentocht.be/tracking/Default.aspx?s=9943">Steven Van Acker (9943)</a><br /><br />I will see you again next year Bornem. I will train and get decent shoes. And after the rain falls with the night, and the sun wipes the sky clean and warms the dawn with its glow, I will gladly drop dead at 53.36km.<br /><br />Unless of course, my training can take me further :)

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2006</span>

    We went paintball shooting 2 days ago, somewhere in Limburg. I'd recommend it to anyone :)<br />You get the chance to fire a weapon at your friends, and not get arrested for attempted murder :P<br /><br />The paintball arena has very strict rules regarding dresscode and weapon safety, and they will punish you if you don't follow the rules. Firing your weapon outside of the arena for example, even if it is by accident, will make you stand in front of a firing squad and taking 5 hits.<br /><br />But that's ok, the bullets don't really hurt that much.<br />Once you get hit in the arena though, the game is over and you have to sit it out outside the arena (obviously). A game lasts about 15 minutes.<br /><br />During the first 2 games, I didn't fire my weapon too much to spare ammo, but that's just stupid.<br />It didn't take me very long to realise that it's better to fire in short bursts, mainly because the weapon is not super-accurate and the first shot only serves to aim.<br /><br />There were 13 players in the arena, divided in 2 groups: yellow and red. I was on the yellow team and we weren't very good at first :)<br />That changed by the end though.<br /><br />As you would expect, a lot depends on what tactic you use in the field. Our first games were more or less without tactics. We split up in 3 pairs and moved along the arena. This is of course stupid if you're not going to cover your partner.<br /><br />By the end, we had developped some kind of unspoken tactic. Everyone spread out and moved along the arena in small steps. I felt that the best tactic would be to outflank the enemy and attack from either the side or the back. That proved to be true :)<br /><br />A while back, I read a great deal about strategy and tactics in computer games such as Enemy Territory. These same tactics can be applied to paintball.<br /><br />It's something to remember for next time :)
