        vegetarian week
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2006</span>

    Vegetarians are people who don't eat meat. All of those I met so far have good reasons for being a vegetarian. Some say they don't like meat, but most of them say they don't believe animals should die just so they can eat. So as a form of protest, they don't eat meat.<br /><br />Well, I couldn't care less about those animals. This week I felt like going on a vegetarian diet again. Not because I believe animals should be spared, or because I don't like to eat meat. I eat vegetarian food this week because I feel like it. Let's see if I can keep it up for a week.<br /><br />So far, I've had 2 warm vegetarian meals (twice fried stuff with rice and vegetables), 1 vegetarian pizza, 1 time soup, 1 time sandwiches with eggsalad and then some cheese sandwiches. Things are going well with me. I'm not showing any signs of degradation or anything. But life is sure more difficult when you're eating veggy stuff. I went to the store today to buy some stuff to eat. I couldn't find anything except grass (or like some people like to call it: salad)<br /><br />Anyway, some information about the past week. I burned 1006KCal on monday 2 weeks ago, and 1052KCal this monday.<br />I've been terribly busy getting <a href='http://www.pulltheplug.org/fu'>FU</a> up and running, and I succeeded. The new modules are in production and there are 2 new challenges available.<br /><br />Besides all that, I went to the driving-license examination center to ask about my temporary drivers license. I was shocked.<br />Let me explain how things work in Belgium.<br /><br />Suppose one day you wake up and you think: What if I took my theoretical exam today ?<br />And so you do. You go over to the examination center and take the exam. Once you pass it you have a score for your theoretical exam. This score is valid for 3 years.<br />Now of course you want to learn how to drive a car. And even better, you want to get a drivers license. So what happens ? You go to the government and ask for a temporary drivers license.<br />They issue one to you for a certain amount of time. This amount of time depends on how you want to learn how to drive. There's a 3-month type, where you take 20 hours of lessons with a driving school and then you get to practice on your own for 3 months after which you do your practical exam.<br />There's a 6 month type where you take 10 hours of lessons and then drive 6 months with a "guide" (your parents most likely) and then take your exam. Finally there's a 9-month type where you don't take lessons and drive 9 months with your parents, after which you take your exam.<br /><br />Now. 1 Lesson costs about 50 euro. That means the 3-month and the 6-month type cost you at least 500 and 1000 euro respectively. Sounds expensive ? You dunno half of it.<br />Thats why alot of people (like me) take the last option and drive around for 9 months.<br /><br />Well, I did all that and due to circumstances (half our house burned down), I did not get enough practice. So then I took lessons (600 euro worth of lessons) after which I took the exam. I failed (still not enough practice).<br /><br />That was last year. I could have taken some more lessons, taken the exam again and failed it again.<br />Come on, let's be serious here. I'm not gonna learn how to drive in 10 hours when other people learn it in at least 3 months.<br />So that's why I decided I would wait untill the score of my theoretical exam expired and I could take it again. My score would be valid for 3 years again, then I could go for another temporary drivers license and learn how to drive all over again, right ?<br />Wrong.<br /><br />It appears our gay backwards legal system says the following: You can't get a new valid temporary drivers license for at least 3 years after your previous temporary license EXPIRED.<br /><br />Ok, what the hell ? So suppose I do my theoretical exam on date X, get my temporary license on date X as well. The exam is valid untill X+3 years, the license untill X+1 year. When the score for my theoretical exam expires at X+3, I can't get a new temporary license untill X+1+3.<br />So what do I do between X+3 and X+4 ? Sit around a whole year with my thumbs up my ass ?<br /><br />I prepared a letter to the ministry of transportation, asking them what the hell I am supposed to do. I want to get my drivers license THIS year (since I have a car THIS year), but I don't want to pay insane amounts to the greedy driver schools. What are my options ?<br /><br />To be continued...

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2006</span>

    I got sick of having to go to preset 13 or 15 to watch some channels I like (noot set the channels to those presets because its the same setting he uses at home)<br /><br />So I reprogrammed the TV to preset those channels to preset 0 and 99.<br />In doing so, I discovered a new channel called "Actua TV" which is a channel that has only politics on it. <br /><br />A real relief! These days TV-stations seem to be competing to broadcast the most mindnumbing crap they can find. All kinds of gameshows, "reality" shows, sports and sensational TV. Where is the quality ?? Where are the movies ? The scientific shows ??<br /><br />People are born smart, and then they become morons by looking at this TV-junk all day long.<br /><br />Anyway, back to this Actua TV.<br />I'm looking at an interview with some minister. These days noone can wait to brand you a rascist when you give a remark about some social problems like immigrants. Saying things like "Immigrants should be treated like everyone else. If they commit a crime they should go to jail. None of this 'But he had a bad childhood' and other crap.", you can get a reply like "Wow! You think all immigrants are criminals ? You're a rascist!") You'd think they would have some basis of fact to call you a rascist then, but no. I think people are just quick to label you, so they can prove to the rest of the world that they have "an opinion". Little do these people know that they are just being influenced by mainstream politics and TV-stations (best brainwashing machines I have ever seen) to THINK that they have an opinion, but actually they just repeat what some "famous" people say about some topic. Just imagine it! Hordes of people who copy the opinion of someone, but don't know the arguments to back it up.<br /><br />Well, I'm drifting again.<br />So this minister is talking about immigrants (allochtonen in Dutch, may need a better translation)<br />and how he believes that there is a problem with participation of them in our society.<br />Then he goes on to say that he has never seen immigrants or their parents/children in Technopolis (a place where people can learn and experiment with science: <a href='http://www.technopolis.be'>http://www.technopolis.be</a>) and he wonders why. "We must encourage these people to come there too"<br /><br />...<br /><br />Sometimes I which politicians would be in the same room when they say idiot things like this.<br />You've never seen immigrants in techopolis ? Really ? HOW COULD YOU TELL YOU JACKASS??<br /><br />It's not because you're an immigrant that you wear a sign saying "Hey! look at me!"<br />Immigrants come in all shapes and colors. Some have different skin color, some dress different, some speak a different language. But there ARE immigrants who look exactly like you and me and who have completely integrated in our society.<br /><br />So excuse me for all you people with an "opinion", but if you wanna talk about immigrants in this way, get your brain straight. If you say stupid things like this, YOU'RE THE RASCIST.<br />Bah!<br />All people are people. When I think of immigrants I think of Swedish people or Americans. I don't think about Turks or Moroccans. Maybe all you people branding others "rascist" should do that too ?<br />

        Burning rubber
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2006</span>

    Have I mentioned yet that I bought a car ?<br /><br />Some time ago a friend of mine suddenly calls me, telling me he's buying a new car and has to get rid of his old one. Since I plan to finally(!) get my drivers license, I will need a car to learn how to drive. And so I bought it.<br /><br />The car is parked behind my house since 31st december. The front-tight tire was flat, so I had to replace it. (I drove the car around in the yard with a flat tire, and really, a car without flat tires is a lot more comfortable).<br /><br />I spent the better part of sunday afternoon trying to:<br /><ul><br /><li>find the jack</li><br /><li>open the hood</li><br /><li>find the spare tire</li><br /></ul><br /><br />After all that, I managed to get the tire of, carry it to the fueling depot across the street and pump up the tire again. Then screwed the wheel back on the car, and everything still worked !<br />That is so nice.<br /><br />After a couple laps around the tree in my yard, I tried something different, like starting on a hill and riding backwards up the hill.<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure if you've ever seen the drive-in to my garage, but it looks something like this:<br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1017716|thumb=0|alt=6127_large.png]<br /><br />Steep doesn't even begin to describe it and I wouldn't advise anyone to learn how to start a car on a hill when you are going to practice on such a steep hill.<br /><br />First of all, I learned to drive with a diesel, not gasoline. The benefit of a diesel engine is that when you are in 1st gear and you press no pedals, the car moves. With a gasoline engine, the engine stalls. That means, if you are on a hill you need to have like 3 feet to do things right.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm on that hill with noot sitting next to me. He tells me to just release the break and give a lot of gas. So I do just that right ? Right! Don't underestimate the power of first gear, even in reverse. I can still smell the burning rubber from my tires. There is a big black scorch-mark on the drive-way and to top all that, I didn't even get the car up the hill.<br /><br />Noot and I switched places and he drove it up there (He has about 50 years more experience driving a car anyway)<br /><br />So what did I learn from all this ? DON'T *EVER* use that hill again to practice starting on a hill.<br /><br />Besides that, it was fun and I learned how to replace a tire<br /><br />

        Flawed logic ?

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2006</span>

    I was not going to write about this, because it makes me look like an idiot :)<br />I try to be as objective and pragmatic as possible in any discussion, but this time I lost my cool.<br /><br />A silly conversation that started a couple days ago became quite serious for some reason I can not remember. The spark that lighted it all was my "statement" that true logic is the basis of all our science and knowledge. All our knowledge is based on a simple logic: either something is right, or it isn't. (The conversation was about the universe being digital and all perceived reality is just a hallucination that extends the digital universe ;) All our scientific theories are based on this.<br /><br />The discussion went on to claim that logic is too simplistic to work with. For example according to Schrodinger (<a href='http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/quantumzone/schroedinger.html'>Schrodingers atom</a>) an electron can be a particle or a wave at the same time. Based on simple logic you would not be able to tell whether an electron was a particle or a wave. This is of course a theory, like anything else we think we know about the universe, and it could be wrong. My conversation partners seemed to disagree however and used this point to claim that logic could be wrong.<br /><br />And that's where I lost my cool ;) Telling a scientist that logic, the most fundamental way of thinking we know, the basis of all science, the only way of thinking I know of, could be wrong, is like telling the pope that there is no god.<br /><br />In science, there are 3 entities we work with. First of all there is the universe we are trying to understand. The universe is all that is physical outside of our mind. Second there is the current theory we have on the workings of our universe. It is our scientific view on the universe, our knowledge. We build it by building on previous knowledge, extrapolating and testing it in the real world. The last entity is logic. We use logic to link the theory with the real universe. If we make an assumption on the workings of the universe, and we do an experiment to confirm it, there are 2 outcomes: either we were right or we were wrong. If we were right, then its partytime because our theory fits the universe. However, if the experiment shows that our theory is wrong, we have to drop this theory and people are usually sad about that. (Although this would be exciting to me because I consider this a bug in the theory, and I love bughunting ;) Whatever the bug is and where-ever it is located, you will always learn something when you track it down and solve it. Even more so with the universe. Every experiment that seems to contradict the current knowledge is important because we WILL learn something new from it.)<br /><br />Anyway, thats my view on it. My explanation on the whole thing was that asking me whether an electron is a particle or a wave is a trap, because we obviously don't know the difference yet: the terms are not defined! If we would have a clear definition of a particle and of a wave, and both did not overlap, then an electron could only be both at the same time if the universe would allow it. If that was the case, then our current theory is wrong because an apple can't be an apple and a pear at the same time (what a flaky comparison). So, my explanation was that the current knowledge was wrong and needed to be refined.<br /><br />Although I should have listened more carefully to what was being said, I was too worked up to even consider it. They were saying that I should consider the possibility that our logic is wrong. At the time that was like blasphemy to me. I could not believe that scientists could speak those words.<br /><br />When evaluating a theory, all 3 entities must be in agreement for the evaluation to be positive. If its negative, then one of the 3 is wrong. (Of course, this conclusion is also based on our logic, but lets not go there :P I'm trying to prove that logic can't be wrong here)<br /><br />One could speculate that the universe is wrong. That would be very ambitious for mankind :) Claiming that our knowledge is correct and we think correctly, yet the physical reality is inconsistent. God would probably smite the first person who claimed this.<br /><br />The most obvious conclusion would be that our knowledge is wrong and we need to adjust it. That's the way we've worked for millenia and it worked so far, so why change it ?<br /><br />Let's however consider the third alternative. What if there is some form of higher logic that we didn't think of ? First of all, would we be able to find it at all ? Our logic is builtin (or so I believe). In our thousands of years of existance, noone has ever proven that our logic is flawed. How would they be able to detect it though ? If our reasoning is wrong, would we be able to prove anything at all ? Wouldn't a flawed reasoning process be able to prove that anything is wrong and right at the same time ? Would flawed logic be able to detect flawed logic ??<br /><br />Anyway, suppose not us, but some other civilisation (or even God for that matter) would come down to us, point their finger and laugh. Then claim that we use a wrong reasoning process and go on to tell us what the right one is. Would we be able to understand it ?? And if we could and we rebuild our entire knowledge using this new logic, would we run in the same problems ?<br /><br />It's a lot to think about. We defined our logic to be true. If our logic, our most basic reasoning capability, was wrong, then nothing we have come up with since the stone-ages can be considered to be correct. Sure, all our inventions could work, but we couldn't prove that there are some conditions that it couldn't work, because those conditions would be out of our comprehension. Even worse: we would not be able to add those conditions to our current knowledge, because they are part of our internal logic ! In order for us to use this new logic, our mind would need to be reflashed with some new firmware.<br /><br />I don't like this idea at all. Before I would accept that our logic was wrong, I would turn every theory upside down, search the entire universe and work myself to death just to prove that our knowledge must be wrong.<br /><br />The chance that our logic is wrong is terribly small, but it exists. And as a scientist I must accept that.<br />

        Drupal modules for Fun University
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2006</span>

    I'm slowly learning how Drupal modules work. Drupal has some nice documentation and lots of modules you can rip apart.<br /><br />The modules I want to build are destined for <a href='http://www.pulltheplug.org/newfu/'>Fun University</a>. Right now, I use standard "story" nodes for the challenges and solutions should be submitted in comments.<br /><br />The advantage to this approach was that I could be lazy and just the default infrastructure :)<br />Unfortunately, the list of disadvantages is a bit longer...<br /><br /><dl><br /><dt>No distinction</dt><br /><dd>There is no way to distinguish between a story I post (with obviously useful content :P :P) and a challenge submitted by someone else: They both end up on the front page which is not what I want. The challenges should be listed separately from for example news items.</dd><br /><dt>No scoring</dt><br /><dd>In a default drupal, there is no way to "score" a node. I want a way to give a "difficulty" rating to each Challenge and a "quality" rating for each Solution. There is a module that provides an API for voting on nodes in Drupal, called <a href='http://drupal.org/node/36041'>VotingAPI</a>, but it doesn't provide any interface. There is a module called <a href='http://drupal.org/node/42905'>SimpleVote</a> which has a very basic voting system. VotingAPI has a 4.6.x version, SimpleVote doesn't. After consulting with the developer of SimpleVote, I tried to use version 4.7.x of both modules in a 4.6.x Drupal. It worked! I now have a SimpleVote module enabled. It allows any registered user to vote on any node. The module doesn't provide a means to specify voting categories or anything and that is probably something I will work on: extending the SimpleVote module.</dd><br /><dt>No startdate/enddate, no hiding of solutions</dt><br /><dd>When a challenge is submitted, it doesn't have to go online right away. Instead, you should be able to set a future release date so that the community isn't overloaded with bursts of new challenges and you can spread the load a bit. That release date is the start date. There should also be an enddate. Between startdate and enddate, no submitted solutions are revealed. This keeps people from reading other people's solutions and forces them to think for themselves ;) After the enddate, all solutions can be viewed. Now, in the default Drupal system, there is no such concept. I'll have to code it myself.</dd><br /><dt>No statistics</dt><br /><dd>It would be nice to have statistics per user about the number of challenges and solutions submitted, aswell as an average of the scores of all challenges and solutions. This would encourage the participants to submit both good challenges and good solutions. Drupal doesn't have something like that by default, so I'll have to look into that aswell. Although statistics are not really required in the beginning, it's something to keep in mind.</dd><br /></dl>
