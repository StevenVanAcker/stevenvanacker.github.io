    I have a day off today because of university patronal holiday. They have half a day of activities planned and it all starts with the "March of the Togati", which consists of a bunch of professors parading in an official toga.<br />They do it at the start of the academic year too. I've never watched it.<br /><br />So today I decided I would get up early and go look at that thing. There was nothing to it. I have pictures :)<br /><br />After that (The entire thing was 1 hour late btw), I went to buy some books from a bookstore that went bankrupt. I got 5 books very cheap:<br /><br /><dl><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580533698/sr=1-1/qid=1138881679/ref=sr_1_1/102-6737404-9614527?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Computer and Intrusion Forensics</a> by Mohay George</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 10 euro while the price on amazon is 76.50$ (70.75$ secondhand). I bought this book because of my interest in the field</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470023163/qid=1138881845/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Handbook of Virtual Humans</a> by N. Magnenat-Thalmann</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 10 euro, sells for 137.89$ on amazon (109.99$ secondhand). I got it because of interest for computer graphics and the SOGLD thing I wrote a while ago</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764541137/qid=1138882068/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Kickin' Bot : An Illustrated Guide to Building Combat Robots</a> by Grant Imahara</dt><br /><dd>I bought it for 5 euro, sells for 16.49$ on amazon (4.97$ secondhand). I got it because of my interest in robotics and it can be something I can use PET melting for. The whole thing probably also has good tips and ideas to motorize noot's telescope</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764558951/qid=1138882351/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">LAN Party : Hosting the Ultimate Frag Fest</a> by William "The Ferrett" Steinmetz</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 5 euro, sells for 16.49$ on amazon (2.95$ secondhand). I got it because the LAN-parties I've organised so far all sucked. I wonder if there is anything good in this book that can help me with the next lanparty</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052182866X/qid=1138882553/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Designing Digital Computer Systems with Verilog</a> by David J. Lilja and Sachin S. Sapatnekar</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 5 euro, sells for 55$ on amazon (34.98$ secondhand). I bought it because I plan to educate myself a bit on digital electronics and FPGA programming. Verilog is similar to VHDL, the hardware description layer.</dd><br /></dl><br /><br />That makes for a total of 302.37$ (223.64$ secondhand) I would have paid, but I got everything for 35 euro. I'd say that's a good deal :)<br /><br />After that, I went to the local secondhand shop and bought a wash-drying machine. I'm gonna pick it up right after this blog message. I also bought an alarmclock...<br /><br />Whew! Now I just finished lunch and my day was already full. It's more fun to get up early in the morning and do lots of things :) I should do it more often.<br /><br />Plans for the afternoon: get a savings account, see if I can buy a photocamera and whatever I feel like.

    It is now 4PM<br /><br />I started the afternoon by picking up the wash-drying machine. Then I went shopping for a digital camera, but the prices are too high.<br />I cleared the snow from the windshield of my car and drove around a bit. I'm getting more comfortable driving around with a car on gasoline.<br /><br />I ended up at the insurance firm and asked about some stuff. I can open a saving account with 6% interest (under some terms), which sounds pretty cool. Adding theft insurance to our house would cost an extra 80 euro per year. And it seems I CAN get insurance for a car without having a drivers license. But since I probably won't get to drive around on my own any time soon, that's just an interesting fact and nothing exciting.<br /><br />Now I'm too tired to do anything. I'll have some tea and then do nothing at all :)<br />

    Some time ago I wrote a patch for img_assist to include acidfree images (<a href='http://drupal.org/node/37154'>http://drupal.org/node/37154</a>)<br />Someone asked if I was going to port it to drupal 4.7.<br /><br />I thought of a better way to do what img_assist does. There could be a generic interface and API to add any type of node through a popup-window like img_assist does.<br /><br />Img_assist is easy to understand in principal: When you click on the "add image" icon next to a text-box, it pops up a window. In that window you select an image by looking at thumbnails. When you click on it a line of text is inserted into the textbox and the popup closes.<br />The inserted line of text is specially formatted so that a parser can process it before the node is rendered and displayed to the visitor.<br /><br />Suppose I want to create a generic popup. When a user clicks on "add something", the popup pops up.<br />He can then chose what kind of node he wants to insert. Like "image","acidfree","node", ...<br />Depending on his choice, a different list of candidates is presented in the form of icons. When he clicks it, a line is inserted into the textbox. The line should mention the type of object being inserted aswell as some index.<br />The filter detected the line of text, parser it and returns the correct HTML code.<br /><br />Now I want to work with hooks so that the entire thing is modular. First of all, a module needs to tell the assist module that it can offer content for the popup window. Next, it has to offer a list of things to include. This list should have icons, ID's of objects and maybe some more info.<br />When its time to render the object inside a node, the module should have a function (=filter callback) to generate HTML code for this specific object.<br /><br />All of this looks pretty easy :)<br /><br />I didn't mention that I would like a tree-structure for nodes though. Like I have for acidfree objects in img_assist... The module should probably have a function to list all branches of a tree aswell. That way, when the user requests to add an acidfree object, he is presented with a tree of subdirectories to chose from. When one is selected, the interface calls the function to get a list of objects for that specific subtree.<br /><br />Now I just need to work out if I can maybe pass object-specific variables through the interface, like img_assist does. It has the option to select whether you want to include the original image or a thumbnail, you can set the size of the image to show, you can choose to insert a filter-tag or actual HTML code etc.<br />Maybe there could be a hook for this aswell...<br /><br />Enough food for thought. If I ever implement this, it would be nice if it was included into drupal by default :)<br />

        Melting PET for something useful

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2006</span>

    It's noot's birthday today ! This morning I got up and hung his door full of balloons. I have a crappy picture that I took with my GSM, and maybe I can upload it to here soon.<br />(Did I already mention that I *finally* managed to download stuff from my GSM with bluetooth?)<br /><br />Anyway, yesterday we were talking about the telescope noot is building. He's going to motorize it and mount a camera on it so that the thing can track stars and take pictures with exposure times of several hours. Sounds cool, especially when you realise that all great astronomical pictures are created this way. The more exposure time, the more light you catch, the more detail you have. All of this of course, if you keep the telescope aimed at a specific point. Because the Earth rotates, you need to counter that movement by automatically rotating the telescope in the opposite direction.<br />That's why a motorized telescope would be cool.<br /><br />To motorise a telescope, you need a telescope, a motor and some cogwheels and electronics.<br />I suggested making the cogwheels ourselves by melting PET, and I got to looking at the whole thing again.<br /><br />I found this site: <a href="http://www.goedjn.com/essays/botplas.html">http://www.goedjn.com/essays/botplas.html</a><br /><br />This guy has been experimenting with PET more than me (mostly because he has an oven that is hot enough).<br />His findings are that melting PET is probably not the best thing to make something. But I don't give up that easily.<br />I've been thinking about the whole molding plastic story, and think that I could make some nice stuff if I suck the mold vacuum as I inject the plastic. I can suck it vacuum by hooking it up to a vacuum cleaner. This would make a nice experiment :)<br /><br />I also found references to some Sky & Tel articles from the 70s (<a href="http://ftissera.free.fr/Webmel/homemade_gears.html">http://ftissera.free.fr/Webmel/homemade_gears.html</a> and <a href="http://astro.umsystem.edu/atm/ARCHIVES/APR96/msg00414.html">http://astro.umsystem.edu/atm/ARCHIVES/APR96/msg00414.html</a>). From what I've read, they sound promising to do stuff like this. I can't find a lot on the internet, so maybe I'll have to visit the library sometime. I have access to the university libraries and I haven't been making use of that privilege much :)
