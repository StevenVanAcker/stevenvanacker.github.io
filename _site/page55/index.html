        VPN and VOIP
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2007</span>

    I've skipped the VPN and VOIP research for my new laptop installation on purpose.<br /><br />To fully implement my VPN wishes, I would have to install a VPN server on my desktop (even for a simple test) and setup firewall rules to test it from the outside. I prefer not to make such "drastic" changes just to test something. What I need here is a good test-setup.<br /><br />For my VOIP wishes, I would need to buy an ISDN-BRI card for my desktop and a VOIP phone for my laptop. That would cost money... Besides, we plan to hire a student to do a summerproject with us involving Asterisk and VOIP.<br /><br />Because the other phases are not really critical in my plans (calendar system doesn't involve much more than installtion evolution and karm, GSM and bluetooth support can't be simulated in vmware, and the desktop search engine is just a matter of installing plain beagle...), I'm looking into what support Ubuntu has for VPN.<br /><br />I installed the vpnc client in my VMWare running Feisty, and to my surprise, it got integrated into the network manager applet instantly. This is what I love so much about Ubuntu: things just work.<br /><br />So now that I have a VPN client, all I need to test is a server :)

    <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2007</span>

    My mistake ! When testing out <a href='https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn'>Ubuntu Feisty Fawn</a>, I accidently downloaded an old version of the CD image. I downloaded Herd-5 instead of the Beta release which can be found here: http://www.ubuntu.com/news/Ubuntu704Beta<br /><br />Where herd-5 crashed with a kernel panic at boot, the beta release carries on happily and brings me to the login screen. From there, it looks like plain old Ubuntu.<br /><br />I've tested <a href='http://www.singularity.be/ubuntu'>my packages</a> in Feisty, and they work perfectly !<br /><br />Evolution works too, aswell as beagle.<br /><br />When beagle is installed, it can be found under "Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Search", not "Places &gt; Search Files". Although I think it should be the latter :/<br /><br />Beagle can also be started by a keyboard shortcut (see beagle preferences in the Search menu)

    One of the things <a href="/node/6823">I wanted to do</a> before starting to mess around with kernel programming, is start a Wiki with information about Netfilter.<br /><br />Now it turns out there already is a wiki, but noone is using it yet. So today, I made the first edit and changed <a href=http://wiki.netfilter.org/wiki/Main_Page"">the main page</a>. <br /><br />I hope many edits will follow, because I believe there is way too little documentation surrouding the <a href="http://www.netfilter.org">Netfilter</a> project.<br /><br />To get some more google hits for the <a href="http://wiki.netfilter.org/">Netfilter Wiki</a>, I'll link it here:<br />http://wiki.netfilter.org/<br /><br />Let the documenting commence !

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2007</span>

    As I reported in <a href="/node/6360">a previous message</a>, I packaged the encrypted filesystem setup, the auto-versioning setup and the auto-backup setup. That wraps up phase 1 and 2 of the <a href="/node/6345/">new laptop installation</a>.<br /><br />I was working on phase 5: calendar and timesheet system, which involves setting up a calendar system for meetings, birthdays and the like, and integrate it with my timesheet system (karm).<br />What I wanted to do yesterday, was to look around in <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">evolution</a> a bit, to see what I can do with it.<br /><br />But when starting evolution, it just falls on its face and crashes. It seems like org-gnome-evolution-startup-wizard plugin located in /usr/lib/evolution/2.8/plugins/ is the main cause of that. SO after just moving the lib and eplug file from that directory to /tmp, I was able to startup evolution. It didn't last long though. After a few clicks, evolution crashed...<br />I would have sent an email through the bugtracker, but my email is not configured in that vmware.<br /><br />So that's when I installed and started <a href="http://beagle-project.org/Main_Page">beagle</a> to see what it can do. It's supposed to have a plugin system to search inside unknown filetypes, and I wanted to check that out.<br />No such luck. Beagle crashes aswell.<br /><br />What's going on here Ubuntu ? Is Ubuntu Edgy being neglected because Feisty is coming up next thursday ? Meh...<br /><br />Maybe I'll just look into the VPN part for now...<br />Or maybe nothing at all, since it's going to 24 degrees outside :)

    <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2007</span>

    Creating private Debian packages in a repository has a lot of advantages. But when this repository gets large enough (and contains very old<br /><br />I maintain a repository of selfcreated Debian and Ubuntu packages. The packages I create get tweaked alot during testing, so that several versions of each package exists in the repository. After some time, these obsolete packages slow down dpkg-scanpackages alot and I've often wished to clean them up.<br /><br />After looking around a bit, I though <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/admin/apt-move">apt-move</a> would provide a solution. But this tool (like many other) seems to assume that I only have a cache repository in /var/apt/cache or where-ever. This is not the case.<br /><br />So I looked at the source of the problem: <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/dpkg-dev">dpkg-scanpackages</a>.
