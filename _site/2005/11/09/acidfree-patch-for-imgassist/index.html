  <h1 class="post-title">acidfree patch for img_assist!</h1>
  <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2005</span>
  Finally, I patched img_assist so it would work together with acidfree.<br />Besides now being able to insert pictures in every node (img_assist inserted links, I changed it to be able to insert thumbnails), one can now browse the acidfree photo albums and make a choice from that. It's a dirty patch, but it works. If you install it without acidfree installed, it will screw up :)<br /><br />Demonstration:<br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1000274|thumb=1|alt=118_large.jpg]<br /><br /><br />I also fixed some bugs, of which the most important one is the "max preview size" or something which switches to displaying links instead of thumbnails in the img_assist popup window, when there are too many thumbnails to be displayed. Somehow, the counter used counted too much photos, which is now fixed.<br />Another "bug" is that in the preview pane of the img_assist window, the entire picture would be loaded, rescaled and displayed, all on the client side. This is of course not what I wanted :) I'm not going to download a 800KB photo to see it resized in a small window, when I want to preview it. That's what thumbnails are for! (also fixed in the patch)<br /><br />Because of the way I coded this patch (I mapped the acidfree image ID's onto regular image ID's, but with an offset of 1000000) you can run into trouble if you have more than a third of a million pictures in the standard image database. Since I don't plan to use that, I'm safe :)<br />
