  <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2005</span>
  Life without a laptop sure is different. Or should I say "life without a computer", since I have none left. <br /><br />I broke my record again on saturday: 1031KCal. After that, I did 4 machines of laundry (!) and improvised stuff to dry my clothes (unfortunately, no pictures of that, you can thank the burglars for that)<br />We're making plans to install an intrusion detection system. More information on that later I suppose, as I wouldn't want to give any details away to you lurking burglars.<br />The police asked me to contact the owner of the house so he could fill out a statement and send it back to the police. Since we can't reach the owner directly, I had to contact his representative (which happens to be a lawyer) He was not available in the weekend, and not yesterday morning. I managed to get a hold of him at noon and he told me some juridical stuff of which I couldn't make any sense. Then he told me he would have to contact some courtroom and told me that I should contact HIM later.<br /><br />Ok, what the hell ? I tried to call him a couple of hours later, but no answer.<br />So far, I'm not liking this guy a lot. We'll see if he answers today...<br /><br />I might be able to get a laptop by the end of the week. It would also be a Dell D610, but with 1GB RAM instead of 512MB and an ATI Radeon X300 instead of the crappy Intel 915GM card I had.<br />So far, so good :) This laptop would be better than the stolen one, except that it doesn't have a DVD-RW :(<br />But that could get fixed I suppose. For now, I can put in the CDRW/DVD combo drive Dell sent us first in error. They never came to pick them up, so yay<br /><br />Quite not to my surprise, ULYSSIS mailed back today that they won't put the Ekonomika server in front of their firewall. This is sad news, but I can't say its illogical. I couldn't believe they said "yes" at first, because if I were still in ULYSSIS, I would have never allowed it. It sets a precedent for other servers and doesn't make ULYSSIS look good.<br />So, the Ekonomika server will still be dependant on the services of ULYSSIS (firewall and switches). In the event of a powerfailure, a UPS would have to power all those to keep Ekonomika online. Since the Ekonomika board-of-directors hasn't decided yet whether they will pay for the 1500VA UPS I had in mind, I should probably consider other options. I will put a page online with the status of Ekonomika and the ULYSSIS network, but obviously not on a server on the ULYSSIS network.<br /><br />Also, this year I would like to be in time with my Christmas cards. I'm currently writing them and I have good hopes that they will be delivered in time ;) (If the Postal service cooperates...)<br />
