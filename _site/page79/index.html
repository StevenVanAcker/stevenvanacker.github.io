    I'm sick of building web interfaces to do all kinds of administrative tasks (KULeuvenNet internal)<br />At this moment, I'm trying to work out a system that allows decentralised sysadmins to edit their DNS information using a secure support site.<br /><br />When people think of such an interface, they expect that it has a lot of functionality. A list with domains they can edit, with links to edit the SOA section. An overview of all zone entries. And then a lot of logic between the lot of it to make their life easier.<br /><br />Well yes, I could make a page where you have to jump between fields and then press "submit" to make a single entry. And I could do automatic checking of IP's and see if a hostname isn't already mentioned. I could automagically update the timestamp on each SOA section.<br /><br />But I'm lazy<br /><br />Instead of doing all the above, I will present the sysadmin with a single text box containing her raw zone information. It's up to the sysadmins to learn to edit it then.<br /><br />And since I'm lazy, I don't plan to implement this myself ofcourse.<br />On top of that, I want the interface to be very generic. Besides DNS, I also want to include firewall rules at a later stage. And maybe DHCP config too.<br /><br />The interface should be pretty simple. Users must be able to login (and logout!) preferably a system that can support shibboleth. Users must be presented with a page containing links to config-sections they can edit. They should only be able to edit those sections...<br />Furthermore, a record should be kept (version control system) of all changes. The software should allow grouping of users if possible. The config-sections should be easy to extract by a backend.<br /><br />If possible, the system should allow custom filters (like in drupal) that can sanity check the config-sections once they are saved. This would give direct feedback to the users.<br /><br />All of this should be configurable by the backend, not by a website (all our configuration is stored centrally and I don't like web-interfaces for administration)<br />The system should preferably be written in PHP and it should be simple and secure (KISS)<br /><br />So, on of the first things that pops into mind is a Wiki. The wiki should have a decent access control system. But besides that, most features are implicitely included in a wiki.<br /><br />I'm now looking at different wiki's (you wouldn't believe how many are out there! Check out these sites: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software</a>, <a href='http://wikimatrix.org/'>http://wikimatrix.org/</a>,  <a href='http://freewiki.info/'>http://freewiki.info/</a>)<br /><br />These look interesting:<br /><a href='http://www.pmwiki.org/'>PMWiki</a>, <a href='http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki'>DokuWiki</a>

    My projection to run 25 laps (10km) yesterday, was a bit optimistic.<br />I only managed o do 13 (5.2km).<br /><br />In my defense, my right leg hurt from the start, I had eaten alot, it was very stormy and I was getting a huge blister smack in the middle of my left foot.<br />But I think the biggest factor is that I was running alone. It made time pass a lot more slowly.<br /><br />That sounds like a bunch of excuses to me :)<br />I should have tried harder.

        automated installations (16)

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2006</span>

    Last weeks presentation on my new server install system (see automated installations) went very well. I had managed to scrap only 4 pages of text together, but I did a 2.5 hour presentation with that.<br /><br />It's possible that I'll get the chance to do another presentation about this, for a much bigger audience. This system could prove useful in other departments :)<br /><br />After my demo, my boss was surprised at how easy an installation was. It boots, shows a little menu with 8 questions (which contains reasonable default values that get regenerated when you change one of the values), and then it starts installing. The rest of the installation process is fully automagic and the next thing you'll see on screen is the login prompt.<br /><br />Since he claims he knows nothing of unix systems, my boss wanted to try it. "If I can do it, anyone can". So I allocated a new machine for a test-install. He put in the CD, booted it up and filled in the values.<br />After that, the installer should have autodetected which network card to use, but it failed there ;)<br />*embarassing*<br /><br />To detect which network card to use, the installer brings up each interface in turn, configured it with the given IP and tries to connect to the FTP-server. If it succeeds, that network card is used. One of the problems I had when programming this system was that everything needed to happen in a limited shell environment. There was no perl, no libc, nothing. All I had to test was netcat and that one didn't even support all the options a normal netcat does.<br /><br />So how can I detect when a connect is not happening ? Simple, I can read the return code from netcat. If it's 0, it succeeded, otherwise it failed. The problem is that when it fails, it will hang forever and we don't want that. So before the netcat does its test, I set a timer for 3 seconds after which the netcat is killed.<br /><br />And that was the problem. In VMWare, 3 seconds of virtual time is like 15 or 20 seconds real time. When testing on the real server, the network test was killed before it could report a working connection.<br /><br />I fixed the problem and (my boss) will run a new test today.

    I've been using graphviz to draw graphs, but my images always suck.<br />I use the default boxes and ellipses to represent nodes. Today I looked for a way to include custom shapes into graphviz, and I discovered the "shapefile" attribute.<br />I could get it to work for EPS files, but not for PNG.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.karakas-online.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2647'>This site</a> has a working example to include custom PNG shapes into a graphviz graph.<br /><br />Now that I know how it works, I can start making some decent networkgraphs

    If I keep going like this, a marathon should be a breeze in a couple months.<br />I ran 20 laps yesterday, which is 8km<br /><br />I should probably do another automated installations blog soon too, since a lot has happened.
