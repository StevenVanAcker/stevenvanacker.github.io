  <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2007</span>
  I've gotten sidetracked from the vacuform construction process. One late night I though it would be fun to see what the heat distribution of my vacuform oven would look like, if I used 9 halogen linear tubes as the heat source distributed evenly over 1 m^2.<br /><br />I went on to build a software simulator to generate some nice pictures of what it would look like. The first simulator was stochastic and the pictures were not really nice (see an older post). Version 2 of the simulator uses real physics to calculate the temperature change in each spot of the vacuform oven.<br /><br />This picture is the result of that simulator:<br />[G2:11745]<br /><br />The color indicates how hot a certain spot is. This is what the gradient looks like:<br />[G2:11748]<br /><br />An AVI file is available here (900KB):<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/vacuform/heat-distribution-non-stochastic.avi<br /><br />And an animated GIF here (2.3MB):<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/vacuform/heat-distribution-non-stochastic.gif<br /><br />Here are all the files and the code (9.5MB):<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/vacuform/heat-distribution-non-stochastic.tar.gz<br /><br />At this point I should probably say that I'm not a physicist or an engineer. So basically, I have no idea what I'm calculating when I do these simulations. They just seem to make sense as far as I know.<br /><br />In any case, this is where I got sidetracked. After spending hours (and hours) on the simulator, I still don't have any reasonable results because I have no idea if my simulator even matches the real world.<br /><br />So, let's just get on with it. Instead of using software to simulate the oven, I just built a smaller version of the oven. <br /><br />These are the professional blueprints<br />[G2:11760]<br />Apologies for not using the more standard cocktail napkin for this, but I had none handy.<br /><br />By the time I got to the basement, the plans had already been revised (just to show how rocksolid my ideas are)<br />[G2:11764]<br /><br />All the wood was cut to length (and recut to length after another design revision)<br />[G2:11767]<br /><br />And some holes were drilled with my newly bought drillstand. This drillstand is actually quite handy. When putting together the vacuform frame, all the holes I drilled were out of alignment. This thing makes sure that all holes are straight.<br />[G2:11770]<br /><br />Of course, it didn't take long to break the stand. What do you expect for 25 euro ? :) I'm taking it back to the shop to be replaced. The stand was still good enough to drill holes though.<br />[G2:11773]<br /><br />The mini-frame I built for this experiment is actually better constructed than it's bigger brother. Using pre-drilled holes, I was able to put the frame together very fast<br />[G2:11776][G2:11779][G2:11782][G2:11785]<br /><br />And here is everything together:<br />[G2:11788]<br /><br />Allright, now we are getting to the "Don't try this at home, kids" part. So, Don't try this at home kids:<br /><br />To mount the linear halogen tube into the oven, I made my own version of a lamp socket using a couple screws and bolts and some high-gauge electrical wire. At this moment, the oven will use only 500W (1 lamp), but when using 9 of them, it will suck 4500W. The wiring I use here is 4mm^2.<br /><br />[G2:11791][G2:11794][G2:11797][G2:11800][G2:11803][G2:11806]<br /><br />When plugged in, the oven lights up nicely<br />[G2:11809]<br /><br />But after only 10 seconds, the wood started to burn<br />[G2:11812]<br /><br />I expected this to happen (really) and bought some heat isolation that is placed behind heaters to reflect the heat. I will put it in there later and try again. Stay tuned
