  <h1 class="post-title">MythTV</h1>
  <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2007</span>
  A while ago I had this idea of buying a new computer and making a media center out of it, using MythTV.<br /><br />After many frustrating months, I managed to install ubuntu on my hardware because the kernel didn't have the right drivers...<br />Then after another month I manage to get the machine not to crash down on me every 2 or 3 days.<br />Now for the "moment supreme": the configuration of MythTV to do something useful.<br /><br />Sit back and relax, this will be a funny story.<br /><br />I installed MythTV even before I managed to get the machine to not crash every couple days, and I ran into the problem of XMLTV.<br /><br />(BTW, I used <a href="http://hyams.webhop.net/mythtv/myth_ubuntu.html">this guide</a> which is actually pretty good considering what a mess MythTV and XMLTV is)<br /><br />Oh, where to start ?<br /><br />XMLTV is a tool that fetches program schedules from the internet, parses them and dumps them in a XML format. But before it can do all that, you need to configure it of course.<br />XMLTV uses "grabbers" to download data from internet and parse it. There are many different grabbers, apparently one for every country code. I have to use tv_grab_be which is the grabber for Belgian programs schedules. It uses my alltime favorite <a href="http://www.teveblad.be">http://www.teveblad.be</a> for the schedules.<br /><br />For no reason I can imagine whatsoever, before you can run this grabber, you need to configure WHICH channels you want data from (So hey, why not have an option that just downloads them all and save everyone a headache ?).<br /><br />This is what such configuration looks like:<br /><pre><br />guest@berta:~$ tv_grab_be --configure<br />using config filename /home/guest/.xmltv/tv_grab_be.conf<br />A nonempty configuration file /home/guest/.xmltv/tv_grab_be.conf<br />already exists.  There is currently no support for altering an<br />existing configuration: you have to reconfigure from scratch.<br /><br />Do you wish to overwrite the old configuration? [yes,no (default=no)] <br /></pre><br /><br />You see, I already have a configuration file and don't want to lose it (because it's hell setting it up in the first place). There is no "append to configuration" or "reconfigure". Nono, it's overwrite or don't. And consequently, if you choose not to overwrite, the program exits like this:<br /><br /><pre><br />Exiting since you don't want to overwrite the old configuration.<br /></pre><br /><br />So, always backup your config!<br /><br />Let's see what it does when overwriting the configfile:<br /><br /><pre><br />Do you wish to overwrite the old configuration? [yes,no (default=no)] yes<br />Enter the language required: [F]rench or [D]utch: D<br />The Default configuration for this grabber is to only grab the summary<br />information for programmes. (channel/start/title/brief description)<br /><br />If you want detailed information (episode name, detailed description,<br />actors) then you must re-configure and run this grabber with the<br />--slow option<br /><br />finding channels from teveblad.be :     teveblad.be Channel id LIFE!TV not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id life!tv.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id ACTUATV not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id actuatv.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id RTL7 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id rtl7.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id S.TELEVISIE not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id s.televisie.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id TV5MONDE not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id tv5monde.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id 11 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id 11.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id AB3 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id ab3.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id ADULTCHANNEL not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id adultchannel.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id ADVENTUREONE not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id adventureone.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id ANIMAL not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id animal.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id BBCPRIME not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id bbcprime.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id BOOMERANG not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id boomerang.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id E!ENTERTAINMENT not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id e!entertainment.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id EURONEWS not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id euronews.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id EUROSPORT2 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id eurosport2.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id EXTREME not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id extreme.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id FRANCE4 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id france4.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id FRANCE5 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id france5.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id HALLMARK not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id hallmark.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id JETIX not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id jetix.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id MOTORSTV not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id motorstv.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id NASN not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id nasn.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id PLAYBOYTV not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id playboytv.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id PRIMEACTION not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id primeaction.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id PRIMEFEZZTIVAL not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id primefezztival.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id PRIMEMOVIES not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id primemovies.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id PRIMEONE not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id primeone.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id PRIMESPORT1 not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id primesport1.teveblad.be<br />teveblad.be Channel id REALITYTV not found in channel_ids_nl file, assuming XMLTV id realitytv.teveblad.be<br />got 88, done.<br />Enter the name of a channel, '.' to finish, '*' to list all: <br /></pre><br /><br />The above garbage is not the list of channels by the way, those are error messages.

Can you use wildcards or something to select a group of channels at once ?"<br />Hahahaha so naive! No you can't!<br />See ?

This actually looks like a good use for checkboxes in a GUI, so what about it ?<br /><br />There is this mention of a GUI in the manpage of tv_grab_be:<br /><br /><pre><br />       --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.  OPTION may be<br />       ’Tk’, or left blank for the best available choice.  Additional allowed values of OPTION<br />       are ’Term’ for normal terminal output (default) and ’TermNoProgressBar’ to disable the<br />       use of Term::ProgressBar.<br /></pre><br /><br />But this option seems not to do anything at all: surprise !<br />I didn't give up here though. I actually found some program somewhere that does all this stuff with a GUI, but instead of using the GUI like it should, it just opens a window with the list of channel and then ASKS in an inputfield what channel to enable. <br /><br />Bah! Down with this junk.<br />It's actually easier to edit the generated configfile manually<br /><br />This will select all channels from "channels_ids_nl", the ones tv_grab_be knows about, and converts them into configuration file lines.<br /><br /><pre><br />cat /usr/share/xmltv/tv_grab_be/channel_ids_nl |grep -v "^#"|sed 's/:.*/ nl dodetail/' | sed 's:^:channel :'<br /></pre><br /><br />If you copy paste all the lines tv_grab_be outputs about channels that it doesn't know about (like the error messages I pasted above) into a file called "output", then the following script will make them into configurationfile lines aswell:<br /><br /><pre><br />cat output |grep "not found in channel_ids_nl"|sed 's:.* :channel :'|sed 's:$: nl dodetail:'<br /></pre><br /><br />This is what my configuration file looks like:<br /><pre><br />#<br /># tv_grab_be config file.<br />#<br /># Format is:<br /># language <fr|nl><br /># detailstarttime <24hr clock time><br /># detailstoptime <24hr clock time><br /># detailgenre <genre regexp>    #- may be repeated mutiple times<br /># channel <xmltv_id> <fr|nl> [dodetail] #- may be repeated mutiple times<br /># <br /><br />#<br /># definition of language mode: fr or nl<br />#<br />language nl<br /><br />#<br /># definition of start and stop times for retrieving detailed<br /># information for programmes.

in front of the line<br /><br />Now that the configuration file is adequate, you can fetch the data and store it in a file, as a test:<br /><pre><br />tv_grab_be --slow --output /tmp/whatever<br /></pre><br /><br />This can take a while...<br />Once the file is ready, you can insert it into the mythtv database with<br /><br /><pre><br />mythfilldatabase --file 1 -1 /tmp/whatever<br /></pre><br /><br />Mythfilldatabase has no manpage by the way, but you can check it's option with "mythfilldatabase --help"<br /><br />Right! That's the XMLTV part.<br />What about MythTV ?<br />Well, following a complicated setup procedure using weird terminology and many many useless(?) default settings (Hey, what's up with all these settings ? Do I even need those ? It's confusing as hell) you should be able to register a TV-card, and hook it up to an XMLTV program schedule.<br /><br />In my case, I had to select Belgian TV schedules (Dutch) which apparently uses the tv_grab_be_tvb command. Of course, this command doesn't exist... I have tv_grab_be, but that is not listed in the mythtv config screen. Great.<br /><br />After some digging around, I found out that this setting is stored in the "videosource" MySQL table. I set it to "tv_grab_be" instead, but it still wouldn't work. Next, I added an alias for tv_grab_be_tvb that points to tv_grab_be, but mythtv ignores it...<br />So finally, I symlinked tv_grab_be_tvb to tv_grab_be in /usr/bin/<br /><br />I was instructed to run "mythfilldatabase --manual", but that coredumped. That's some really stable piece of software we have here...<br /><br />Oh by the way, I just realized that the steps I'm complaining about are not really in the order I did them in the first place. Before mythfilldatabase actually succeeded, I believe I had to make another symlink because mythtv didn't find the xmltv configuration file.<br /><br />If you have the same problem, look at the output of mythfilldatabase. It should say something like "file /home/blabla...whatever not found. Run me with --configure"<br /><br />That error comes from tv_grab_be, which can't locate the file that mythtv passes to it. In my case the file was /home/guest/.mythtv/pvr500-1.xmltv and I symlinked that to /home/guest/.xmltv/tv_grab_be.conf<br /><br /><pre><br />guest@berta:~/.mythtv$ ln -s ../.xmltv/tv_grab_be.conf pvr500-1.xmltv<br /></pre><br /><br />MythTV has the ability to scan for channels and store the result in it's database.<br />But the names of the channels are all wrong. I looked up the channel frequencies once and made a bunch of scripts to tune my TV-card from the commandline, by using the channel name as a command.<br /><br />I got the frequencies <a href="http://www.upcbelgium.be/upcbe_lvnl2/index.php?PageID=147027&SessionID=4ddae96c1ae36f8c8c4ad4ebbf997040&R=10502">here</a><br /><br />After the scan was complete, there were 67 channels in the database. <br />So now comes the task to rename all those channel names...<br />It occurs to me that there probably needs to be a link between the MythTV channel names and those used in XMLTV. Although I'm nore sure what the link is yet.<br /><br />...<br /><br />It appears that XMLTV fills in the channel database itself (or that's what mythtv claims).<br />I deleted all channels and tried adding the xmltv output file again. It wouldn't load because the backend wasn't running. And that backend wasn't running because the storage directory (where it records all shows in) wasn't writable by whatever user the backend runs as.<br /><br />After fixing that, I was able to watch TV, but the channels were only showing static and only 1 channel was in the program schedule of MythTV.<br /><br />In the mythtv-setup program, there is a menu "Input Connections" where there is a setting "fetch channels from listing", which appears to do something ?<br /><br />Anyway, I had to run "/etc/cron.daily/mythtv_backend", which complained that it couldn't find the xmltv configfile.<br />A closer look in that file revealed that is was trying to run as user mythtv, which I don't use. So I had to change it to "guest"<br /><br />...<br /><br />That still didn't fix anything.<br /><br />Dumping the database shows that for some reason, Kanaal2 now has no freqid (the frequency) and that the channel number (E23) is set to Ka2. Of course this won't work...<br />I manually reset it to the right settings and now this channel works!<br /><br />You can also change the channel settings by pressing "e" while watching it. I wonder what other keys there are...
