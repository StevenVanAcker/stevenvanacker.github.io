    I spent an hour yesterday, putting my lenses in. I tried a number of techniques suggested on internet, but none of them really worked. So I invented one of my own. Instead of inserting a lens with my index finger, I put on my little finger. Also, I just look straight ahead and apply the lens. An important thing noone has yet mentioned to me, is that you need to apply the lens at the center of your eye (the iris). Once your finger is in your eye, you see nothing, so you have to feel what you're doing (sounds scary isn't it ? It is at first :) but after a couple times there's nothig to it). The iris feels like a small bump on your eye. When you put the lens there, it sticks by itself.<br /><br />Yesterday I applied the lens after some time. I then poured a small amount of the lens liquid on the mirror and used it as a magnifying glass, to look at where the lens was.<br />I noticed that the lens was not centered around my iris. I was hoping this was just a mistake on my side and not a flaw in the lens. After putting in the lens today and checking it again, I'm pretty sure it was my mistake.<br /><br />I inserted the lens on the second attempt today, so I'm improving :)<br />If I can remove it easily today, I might try inserting the left one too.<br /><br />Removing the lens is not as easy at it appears. Yes, when you insert a lens it will "fall" out frequently. But once it sticks, there's no easy way to get it off.<br />I spent some time trying to get it off yesterday and it worked. I touch the lens with my little finger, and then look up and slide the lens down at the same time. Then, I squeeze the lens with my thumb and index finger. When I blink then, the lens comes out. I hope I can repeat this today :)<br /><br />On a side not, it's strange not wearing glasses and being able to type this blog (and even read the teletext on the TV). I found I can even read the small letters on the instructions of my lens fluid.<br />Despite the advantages of these lenses, I can't help but feel naked without my glasses. I'm sure the feeling will subside.<br /><br />I wonder what it feels like to have wind blowing in my eyes when I'm riding a bike :) Wearing glasses keeps the wind from your eyes, among other things like bugs, dust and pieces of concrete walls when you're rebuilding a house ;)<br /><br />I've removed the lens, inserted it again and removed it again. I'm getting skilled at it :)<br />Removing the lens is done by looking up, the sliding down the lens while looking up and finally grabbing it between thumb and index finger (also while looking up)

    <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2006</span>

    I triggered something that I only saw once before.<br />The grub-installer is confused about where to install the bootsector and asks the user.<br />This is of course something I don't want to see in an automated installation.<br />[img_assist|fid=1017728|thumb=1|alt=6189_large.png]<br /><br />Setting the grub-installer/bootdev value to "(hd0)" in preseed solves that problem.<br /><br />I've now tested all combinations of 1 or 2 disks and single or RAID install. It works nicely :)<br />Wiping the disks with dd every time I install slows things down too much so I made it an installation feature. So far I've listed 4 installation features: WipeDisks, RAID, DRBD and KeepAlived. The last 2 do nothing yet and that's what I will work on next.<br /><br />You want screenshot ?<br />[img_assist|fid=1017731|thumb=1|alt=6190_large.png]<br /><br />At the moment, I have 8 screens where the user is prompted a question.<br />A lot of the answers can be precalculated. So I'm considering having a less "serial" configuration where the user has to go through all questions.<br /><br />I'll make a single config menu where all precalculated answers are listed. The user can then select which ones to change.<br /><br />Done! :)<br /><br />it looks like this:<br />[img_assist|fid=1017734|thumb=1|alt=6191_large.png]<br /><br />With option 8 leading to the previous screenshot.<br />

    My contactlenses had arrived earlier this week and I had an appointment yesterday to learn how to put them in.<br />The girl at Pearl Vision (where I bought the contact lenses) (who is probably the best looking girl in this country btw, and I confirmed it after putting my glasses back on too) told me that my kind of lenses (torical) are the hardest to put in. And she was right I suppose.<br />I spent the first 30 minutes trying to put in the right lens, which succeeded. My eye was red from all the poking...<br />Then after trying to put in the left one for another 10 minutes, she told me it was probably best if I practiced at home ;)<br />Trying to remove the lens was not any easier. The thing just wouldn't get off.<br />In the end she took out the lens herself because the store was about to close. After she complimented me on my extraordinary patience, I was "allowed" to leave with the lenses.<br /><br />The coming week I'm supposed to practice putting them both in. On thursday next week I have another appointment to get some kind of measurement on the lenses.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/contact_lenses.htm'>This site</a> advises another way of inserting lenses. Maybe I should try that aswell.

    The 13 in the title is not promising, good thing I'm not superstitious :)<br /><br />I had some problems with grub not wanting to install on the RAID system yesterday, but that's solved. I apparently didn't mention it in the blog from yesterday.<br /><br />Inside the Debian installer, the RAID set is referred to as /dev/md/0, while the installed Debian environment refers to it as /dev/md0. Grub looks at the /etc/fstab on the target system when it executes grub-install (inside a chroot /target/) and then can't find /dev/md/0.<br /><br />So, changing /dev/md/0 to /dev/md0 in /target/etc/fstab solved all the problems. The debian-installer happily installs grub as if nothing happened.<br /><br />I've spent the rest of the day perfecting 2 scripts: make_partitions_single and make_partitions_raid. The first is to partition a single disk, the second to partition 2 disks in a RAID set.

    My 3D projects are getting way not enough attention.<br />I've looked at ogre3d once more today and finally found why it wouldn't work.<br /><br />I installed the Debian packages for ogre3d (libs, -dev and -docs) and tried to compile the SampleApp.cpp provided on the website. This of course didn't work because ExampleApplication.cpp and ExampleApplication.h are required, both nowhere to be found except in the sourcecode...<br />After installing even more files lige plugins.cfg and so on, It would finally DO something. It just didn't do much :( All I saw was a small black window asking me to select a renderer. And I couldn't select anything.<br /><br />Today I looked into plugins.cfg after a hint from google and made the plugins directory point to /usr/lib/OGRE<br /><br />Now at least it shows something :)<br />Just nothing in 3D yet...<br /><br />Screenshots soon ? I hope so
