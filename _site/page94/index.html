        livingroom redesigned

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2005</span>

    I'm sitting in our newly designed livingroom today.<br />Nixe was cleaning up yesterday when he suggested that it might be better if we moved the diningroom furniture and livingroom furniture around and we did.<br />It certainly looks more efficient this way. I'll upload a picture when I take one (and when I manage to get an easy interface to do so)<br /><br />I've been looking at the img_assist code to see if I can fit in code to support acidfree albums. It looks easy enough, and I might be experimenting with it later today.<br />Things I still need to make uploading pictures not a pain in the ass: <br />- Windows XP Publish to web facility<br />- an easy way to add images from acidfree into any node (i.e. img_assist, but modified to use acidfree backend)<br />- a faster way to rotate images once they have been uploaded<br />- an easier way to create an acidfree album<br /><br />Maybe I can make a perlscript that will automagically create an acidfree album and upload an entire batch of pictures into it. Something like the galleryadd.pl script from <a href='http://lsb.blogdns.net/software/image_pub'>image_pub</a>, but for use with acidfree.<br /><br />In other news, I think I will by myself a <a href='http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?key=HW-SPAR3-CPLD-DK'>Spartan 3 High Volume Starter Kit Bundle</a> from Xilinx to fiddle with FPGAs a bit<br /><br />For today, I plan to go through the rest of this 1800-page NetScreen manual (of which I've read 670 pages so far) and hope my eyes don't burn out by reading all that "we have our own terminology" blabber...<br />

        All Work We Put Into Bang Lanparty Last
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Nov 2005</span>

    All the work we put into the BANG LanParty the last month paid off.<br />It was a real success, maybe not externally but surely internally: only 9 participants showed up...<br />It was an internal success because everything was so well organised. The plan was to start at 15h, 4 hours before the lanparty started, and end at midnight the next day, 5 hours after the lanparty ended.<br /><br />We actually started a bit earlier than 15h, because I called ALMA (I had reserved us about 15 tables from there) around noon, and they told me the person I arranged everything was on holiday and we would have to reschedule. Instead of 15h, we had to start moving the tables at 14.30h.<br />I rounded up whoever was around to move the tables, and we started moving 15 smaller ones. Congrats to gunnie for being on time, Basik for showing up, and s-king for lending a hand when he didn't have to :)<br />When those tables were moved, we also took 3 larger and heavier tables from ALMA (with their consent)<br /><br />After moving all the other stuff (computers, switches, power-cables, projector, ...) and positioning the tables, connecting everything and doing a networktest, we bought some softdrinks and put them in the fridge.<br /><br />Everything was setup by 18.30h or so. The first participant arrived at 18.55h. (His name was Evert ;)<br /><br />We charged 2 euros for entrance, and they got 2 "drinking tokens" for free (which cost 1 euro each, so its actually free entrance if you buy 2 drinks)<br /><br />The lanparty itself was really fun. I think we were with about 16 people in total.<br />Games that were played include Enemy Territory, Unreal Tournament, Quake 4, Starcraft and Crack Attack.<br /><br />We ordered pizza around 21.00h and then played some more. I think pretty much everybody stayed untill 7.00h on saturday. I went to sleep, like most people :)<br />Gunnie stayed up all night, guarding everything. When I got back around 12, there were only 5 or 6 people left, and I had missed breakfast :(<br />Next time, I'm bringing a sleeping bag and I'll sleep on the floor, just to not miss breakfast.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind next time, is that we try to divide the power usage equally over all outlets. Maybe we can attach power-distribution boxes to each table or so ?<br />I have some nice pictures of the inside of a power distributor that was smoking and stinking, and that had melted...<br /><br />We started cleaning up at 19.00h and were done at 21.00h. Nothing exciting happened after that: I went to sleep early :)<br /><br />On sunday, I was doing the dishes when suddenly the power went out. At first I thought they had cut us off because last friday some guy from Index.is (they do the power-consumption measuring) came by and checked our meter. He said we had used up 900 Megawatthours and that it was probably an error. Well, I surely hope so, we don't have a particle accelerator in the basement or anything, so I don't see how we could have used up almost a terawatthour.<br /><br />Anyway, it appears that the power went down in the entire street. So I dig up some paperwork from Nuon (our power deliverer) and call them up. The call goes something like this:<br /><br />*them* Hello, welcome at nuon.<br />*them* If you have a question regarding electricity, press 1.<br />*them* If you have a question regarding gas, press 2.<br />*me* <pressing><br />*them* Please contact your regional agency. <they><br /><br />I'm impressed by their customer-service!<br /><br />So I dig up some other number and call them (on the paper it says: 24/24, so I assume you can call them anytime) The call goes like this:<br /><br />*them* You have reached the regional agency. We are closed. Please call <some> <hangup><br /><br />People are so friendly these days. I was starting to think if I was ever going to hear a real voice on the other side (it appears that I wouldn't be having that pleasure...)<br /><br />I call the next number....<br /><br />*them* Welcome! Please enter your postal code so we can help you quicker.<br />*me* <entering><br />*them* Welcome! Please enter your postal code so we can help you quicker.<br />*me* <entering><br />*them* You have selected 3001. Our engineers are currently working on a problem in HEVERLEE (which happens to be where I live, yay!) and are expecting to finish at 16.00h. If you still wish to talk to an operator, press 1.<br /><br />Then, something wonderful happened! They DIDN'T hang up! The message kept repeating, giving me the pleasure to hang up on THEM!<br /><br />The power went back up at 16.00h, just as they promised.<br />The rest of the day was uneventful.<br /><br />Today is monday, and I just got back from returning the tables to ALMA. Gunnie, Basik and harry helped. It was heavy work, but we managed. The people from ALMA said that next time we should ask if we can borrow a cart...<br />... just in time.<br /><br />I returned the key at 9.00h but didn't get my deposit back yet. The people from the WAAG will check if we cleaned everything up, and I can go back at 14.00h to see if they are pleased with our work. Let's hope so :) I'd like to have my 250 euros back...

    sick of trying to find a working photo-album module in 4.5, I'm now trying 4.6.<br />Since Debian doesn't yet have packages for it, I'm screwed and I have to install from source :(<br />Did I have trouble upgrading ? You'd better believe it!<br />I can't get the smileys to work :(

        "Flemish unemployment diminishes for the first time in 5 years"

    <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2005</span>

    The newspaper I usually read (<a href='http://www.standaard.be'>De Standaard</a>) is running a story on how the unemployment rate went down for the first time in 5 years. They claim they got the data from the (<a href='http://www.vdab.be'>VDAB</a>, the Flemish service for employment stuff.<br />I really can't believe that.<br /><br />So I checked out the VDAB site. At first I couldn't find the numbers they were referring to, untill I noticed it was on the front page (no detailed numbers like I was expecting, but just the interpreted data in the front story)<br />Let's have a look at that!<br /><br />"Flanders had 241114 unemployed people looking for a job in October 2005. That's 3346 or 1.4% less than last year [There were 244460 in Oct 2004, so thats right]<br />The comparisons on a yearly base are no longer corrupted by the participation of older jobhunting people with mini-exemption [what the hell is that??] and the PWA-employees [unemployed people who are allowed to do small shores in exchange for a small amount of money]."<br /><br />So lets get this straight. The unemployment numbers decreased a bit, but we used a different method of counting. So what does this prove ? That the economy is improving ? Of course not! Numbers from september 2005 and 2004 indicate that the unemployment increased from 243324 to 248624 (5300 extra), from 260307 to 265845 in august (5538 extra), from 241476 to 256446 in july (14970 extra) etc.<br /><br />This is a typical example of the media trying to misguide the public with twisted numbers. And of course or government is adding to the hoax, by claiming that other countries are not following this trend (Why would they ? Maybe they don't throw around wrong numbers)<br /><br />Why are these people not counted in the statistics ? I don't see why they should not be labelled "unemployed" ? It's not like that term is an insult or something.<br /><br />So much disgusting media-manipulation in Belgium, it makes me sick
