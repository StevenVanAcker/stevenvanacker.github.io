  That's one newyear's resolution down. I went to a sports event.<br />In this case, a basketball game, the last of the season.<br /><br />The reason why I wanted to go to a sportsevent was to find out why people are attracted to it and why they get so excited about it.<br />I used to wonder what was so special about a footballgame and what made all those people cheer or boo.<br /><br />Well, now I know.<br /><br />It's one thing to view a game on TV but it's totally different when you're smack in the middle of it. The distance to the players is different, you can see the entire field and see very move. But that's not all. Somehow, everyone next to you is following the game with great concentration and it's infectious.<br />Before you know it, you feel your blood pumping and you're cheering with the best of them. It's a great feeling :) To be part of some group and reacting in a group-response.<br />
