  <h1 class="post-title">Getting up early ROCKS</h1>
  <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2006</span>
  I have a day off today because of university patronal holiday. They have half a day of activities planned and it all starts with the "March of the Togati", which consists of a bunch of professors parading in an official toga.<br />They do it at the start of the academic year too. I've never watched it.<br /><br />So today I decided I would get up early and go look at that thing. There was nothing to it. I have pictures :)<br /><br />After that (The entire thing was 1 hour late btw), I went to buy some books from a bookstore that went bankrupt. I got 5 books very cheap:<br /><br /><dl><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580533698/sr=1-1/qid=1138881679/ref=sr_1_1/102-6737404-9614527?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Computer and Intrusion Forensics</a> by Mohay George</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 10 euro while the price on amazon is 76.50$ (70.75$ secondhand). I bought this book because of my interest in the field</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470023163/qid=1138881845/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Handbook of Virtual Humans</a> by N. Magnenat-Thalmann</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 10 euro, sells for 137.89$ on amazon (109.99$ secondhand). I got it because of interest for computer graphics and the SOGLD thing I wrote a while ago</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764541137/qid=1138882068/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Kickin' Bot : An Illustrated Guide to Building Combat Robots</a> by Grant Imahara</dt><br /><dd>I bought it for 5 euro, sells for 16.49$ on amazon (4.97$ secondhand). I got it because of my interest in robotics and it can be something I can use PET melting for. The whole thing probably also has good tips and ideas to motorize noot's telescope</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764558951/qid=1138882351/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">LAN Party : Hosting the Ultimate Frag Fest</a> by William "The Ferrett" Steinmetz</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 5 euro, sells for 16.49$ on amazon (2.95$ secondhand). I got it because the LAN-parties I've organised so far all sucked. I wonder if there is anything good in this book that can help me with the next lanparty</dd><br /><dt><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052182866X/qid=1138882553/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-6737404-9614527?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Designing Digital Computer Systems with Verilog</a> by David J. Lilja and Sachin S. Sapatnekar</dt><br /><dd>Bought it for 5 euro, sells for 55$ on amazon (34.98$ secondhand). I bought it because I plan to educate myself a bit on digital electronics and FPGA programming. Verilog is similar to VHDL, the hardware description layer.</dd><br /></dl><br /><br />That makes for a total of 302.37$ (223.64$ secondhand) I would have paid, but I got everything for 35 euro. I'd say that's a good deal :)<br /><br />After that, I went to the local secondhand shop and bought a wash-drying machine. I'm gonna pick it up right after this blog message. I also bought an alarmclock...<br /><br />Whew! Now I just finished lunch and my day was already full. It's more fun to get up early in the morning and do lots of things :) I should do it more often.<br /><br />Plans for the afternoon: get a savings account, see if I can buy a photocamera and whatever I feel like.
