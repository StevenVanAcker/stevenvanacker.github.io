  Some time ago I wrote a patch for img_assist to include acidfree images (<a href='http://drupal.org/node/37154'>http://drupal.org/node/37154</a>)<br />Someone asked if I was going to port it to drupal 4.7.<br /><br />I thought of a better way to do what img_assist does. There could be a generic interface and API to add any type of node through a popup-window like img_assist does.<br /><br />Img_assist is easy to understand in principal: When you click on the "add image" icon next to a text-box, it pops up a window. In that window you select an image by looking at thumbnails. When you click on it a line of text is inserted into the textbox and the popup closes.<br />The inserted line of text is specially formatted so that a parser can process it before the node is rendered and displayed to the visitor.<br /><br />Suppose I want to create a generic popup. When a user clicks on "add something", the popup pops up.<br />He can then chose what kind of node he wants to insert. Like "image","acidfree","node", ...<br />Depending on his choice, a different list of candidates is presented in the form of icons. When he clicks it, a line is inserted into the textbox. The line should mention the type of object being inserted aswell as some index.<br />The filter detected the line of text, parser it and returns the correct HTML code.<br /><br />Now I want to work with hooks so that the entire thing is modular. First of all, a module needs to tell the assist module that it can offer content for the popup window. Next, it has to offer a list of things to include. This list should have icons, ID's of objects and maybe some more info.<br />When its time to render the object inside a node, the module should have a function (=filter callback) to generate HTML code for this specific object.<br /><br />All of this looks pretty easy :)<br /><br />I didn't mention that I would like a tree-structure for nodes though. Like I have for acidfree objects in img_assist... The module should probably have a function to list all branches of a tree aswell. That way, when the user requests to add an acidfree object, he is presented with a tree of subdirectories to chose from. When one is selected, the interface calls the function to get a list of objects for that specific subtree.<br /><br />Now I just need to work out if I can maybe pass object-specific variables through the interface, like img_assist does. It has the option to select whether you want to include the original image or a thumbnail, you can set the size of the image to show, you can choose to insert a filter-tag or actual HTML code etc.<br />Maybe there could be a hook for this aswell...<br /><br />Enough food for thought. If I ever implement this, it would be nice if it was included into drupal by default :)<br />
