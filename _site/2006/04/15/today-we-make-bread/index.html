  <h1 class="post-title">Today, we make bread</h1>
  <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2006</span>
  It's easy to get up in the morning when you have something to look forward too.<br />Today I had a couple things planned.<br /><br />I got up at 7.30 and watched some TV till 8am.<br />Then I replaced all 4 tires of my car with the spare ones (I had wide tires mounted, but one of them has a leak)<br />It took me 49 minutes (!)<br /><br />Now I'm researching how I can put the CD-player in my car instead of the cassette-deck.<br /><br />In case I lose the information, here it is:<br /><br /><pre><br />Clarion DRB 4275 CD player.<br />Power: <br />  black: ground<br />  red: after contact (permanent)<br />  orange: lights<br />  blue: automatic antenna<br />  yellow: memory (after key) (?)<br />Speakers:<br />  brown: right rear +<br />  brown/white: right rear -<br />  grey: right front +<br />  grey/black: right front -<br />  white: left front +<br />  white/black: left front -<br />  green: left rear +<br />  green/black: left rear -<br /></pre><br /><br />On the internetz, I found the following:<br /><pre><br />Gray=right front+<br />Gray/Black=right front-<br />Green=left rear+<br />Green/Black=left rear-<br />Violet=right rear+<br />Violet/Black=right rear-<br />POWER ACCESSORY<br />Yellow 14ga=battery main/memory<br />Yellow 18ga=batteryCeNet power/memory<br />Red=accessory(ignition on)<br />Black=ground<br />Blue=Antenna turn on+<br />Blue/White=remote turn on (amps)+<br />Orange/White=dimmer<br />Brown=phone mute<br />Orange=parking brake video lockout<br />White/Red=CCD(camera)input instant on<br /></pre><br /><br />It doesn't describe what I'm seeing on my CD-player, but I noticed the page was 404 and already in google cache ;) So I mirror it for your pleasure.<br /><br />When I looked at the CD-player, I also noticed that the orange cable is not connected to a pin.<br /><br />Ok, it's now 11.25am.<br />I've canibalised the cassette deck, cut all its wires and connected the CD-player. The connector for the antenna was broken in my car, so I had to fix it.<br />I sacrifised a couple of nails, a red marker, a coathanger, some matches and lots of tape to rebuild the connector.<br /><br />And now I have sound in my car ! :) Both CD's and radio work well.<br />Unfortunately, the huge subwoofer in my trunk is not doing anything.<br />I should look into it later.<br /><br />When I first switched on the CD-player, it started playing music. It appears the previous owner (my grandfather) forgot to take out the CD :)<br />It's a Frank Sinatra CD and not really my kind of music. I'll return it first chance I get.<br /><br />It's now 8.14PM<br />I've made a bread, from scratch and its huge :)<br />It looks like it went really well too. I'll have a taste tonight.<br />While the bread was in the oven, I dug out 2 trees in the backyard. They were in the way for my next plan: a parallel parking excercise to practice on.<br /><br />When (not if) I'm good at parallel parking and the other maneuvers, I'll go back to the driving school and ask a couple lessons after which I'll take my drivers exam again
