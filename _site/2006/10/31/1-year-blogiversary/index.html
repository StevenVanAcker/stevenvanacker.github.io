  <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2006</span>
  It's been 1 year since my first post. The only thing that changed, is that I don't seem to bring up the effort to post blog-entries :)<br /><br />Some updates from the past couple days... <br /><br />I put an IDE controller in a PCI slot of my new machine at home (called Dikke Berta or Berta short, since it has 1.25TB of storage and that's even fatter than bigboy which only had 560GB)<br />and was able to boot ubuntu and install it. Some problems occured though. From time to time I would find my machine totally dead. With nothing in the logs, I (apparently rightfully so) suspected a hardware problem. My harddisks were not cooled and were running at between 50 and 60 degrees C.<br /><br />After adding 2 coolers, the temperature dropped by 20 degrees. I haven't had a crash since...<br /><br />In the area of stepper motor controller, I've put together an L297 and L298N chip and hooked it up to a PC PSU and my K8000. It works nicely, and I only need data signal coming from my computer (the clock signal) instead of the 4 I used without microchips.<br /><br />I have some pictures, although not online yet.<br /><br />I really should get working on a good way to post images on drupal...
