  After going to Pearl Vision to buy me some contact lenses (they will call me when they arrive), I went to the book-fair with Spie.<br />There were some fine books last year and I remember that we spent quite some time over there last time. This year however, the choice was somewhat limited. And when I say limited I mean there were no good books. At all. I any category. At the entire fair.<br /><br />I'm starting to become aware of the difference in knowledge between the average joe and university students...<br />You can find just about any book on computers that talks about how to do whatever in Windows, or how to use the internet (after 10 years, I think most people know how to use it, really). But if you look for some scientific work, where are you supposed to go ? Are there actually some fairs for scientific books ?<br />Well, we left much sooner than expected, and I didn't buy anything.<br /><br />On a totally different subject, the battery of my car died again. Instead of jumpstarting again, I bought a battery charger this time. It works nicely and I'm sure I'll have to use it a lot in the future.
