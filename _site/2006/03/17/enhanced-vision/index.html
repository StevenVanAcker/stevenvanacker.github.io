  My contactlenses had arrived earlier this week and I had an appointment yesterday to learn how to put them in.<br />The girl at Pearl Vision (where I bought the contact lenses) (who is probably the best looking girl in this country btw, and I confirmed it after putting my glasses back on too) told me that my kind of lenses (torical) are the hardest to put in. And she was right I suppose.<br />I spent the first 30 minutes trying to put in the right lens, which succeeded. My eye was red from all the poking...<br />Then after trying to put in the left one for another 10 minutes, she told me it was probably best if I practiced at home ;)<br />Trying to remove the lens was not any easier. The thing just wouldn't get off.<br />In the end she took out the lens herself because the store was about to close. After she complimented me on my extraordinary patience, I was "allowed" to leave with the lenses.<br /><br />The coming week I'm supposed to practice putting them both in. On thursday next week I have another appointment to get some kind of measurement on the lenses.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/contact_lenses.htm'>This site</a> advises another way of inserting lenses. Maybe I should try that aswell.
