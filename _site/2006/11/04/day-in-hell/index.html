  <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2006</span>
  Today was a winner in the TOP-10 of suckiest days in my life.<br /><br />The goal was to compile a 2.6.16 kernel with all the needed drivers, including those for vmware. I've spent the ENTIRE day doing 20 or 30 compiles, without success. In the end, I just gave up.<br /><br />On top of that, the changes I made in the webserver configuration of the Ekonomika server were acting up. Normally a redirect directive should apply to the virtualhost it is defined in. Not anymore it seems.<br />For some reason, the normal redirect from ekonomika.be to www.ekonomika.be was overridden and pointed to mailman.ekonomika.be.<br />I couldn't find anything that could explain this behavior, except that redirects are now globally effective (which is denied by the documentation).<br />So what is it ? A bug in apache ? Is my config wrong ? bah! It worked before, why should it suddenly fail ?<br /><br />To make things worse, I was involved in solving a problem with drivers in Windows XP... over MSN... involving someone who knows nothing of computers...<br />I spent an hour trying to figure out what was happening on the other screen, to the point where I was about to lose it.<br /><br />Windows blows.<br /><br />I'm gonna make a T-shirt that reads: Take your lousy Windows problem and shove it up your ass.<br /><br />Or something more fitting, in case small children are around.<br /><br />To ease my mind, I'm trying to solve the problem with the kerneldrivers in vmware. I found <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:ZzrPt1by8vsJ:https://bear.eecs.umich.edu/trac/wiki/LinuxKernel+vmware+kernel+config+2.6+buslogic+&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=8&client=opera">this reference</a> which states<br /><pre><br />It appears that VMware's default SCSI driver also has problems. In the VMware<br />setup, choose to use the BusLogic SCSI driver instead of the default. That<br />seemed to help the boot process get futher later on.<br />...<br />Create a VM in VMware for the Fedora Core 4 installation. I used the BusLogic<br />SCSI driver. To do this, when setting up the VM initially, choose "Custom"<br />instead of "Typical". Later on in the setup process, choose BusLogic instead<br />of the default SCSI driver.<br />...<br />If you have problems when booting, you may want to capture the system boot<br />messages. You can do this by redirecting them to a fake serial port, and having<br />VMware capture the fake serial port to a file. See http://www.coolverification.com/2005/12/debugging_fc4_k.html for details.<br /></pre>
