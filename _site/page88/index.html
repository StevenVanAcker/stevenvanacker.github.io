    The task to maintain about 70 Debian machines fell upon me when I accepted my current job.<br />At this moment, we have 70 machines running Debian releases from Debian testing all the way to Debian slink (!). That includes the versions testing (no release I think), sarge (3.1), woody (3.0), potato (2.2) and slink (2.1).<br />Furthermore, noone ever seemed to care a lot about keeping things clean and easy to manage, so instead of making Debian packages, putting them in a central repository and installing from there, most software we use (including daemons, kernels, perl libraries, etc) are compiled from source.<br />To make things even worse, some software that exists as Debian packages, is installed from source. The reason for the latter is that, if they updated to the next Debian release, my colleagues were scared that the entire distribution might break. So they decided to just keep the distribution as it was and compile things from source.<br /><br />I got sick of this situation quite rapidly. I have no problem patching a single kernelsource and compiling it with special options enabled. But when this compilation process is the same for all 70 machines, I see no reason why I should log into each machine and execute the same set of commands on them all (downloading, unpacking, patching, configuring, compiling and installing the software all by hand).<br />Instead, I created a script that does all the above and makes a nice clean Debian package that goes into a central repository. Then I just install the package on all servers. Problem solved !<br /><br />Not quite.<br /><br />Besides maintaining software, I also need to install new machines from time to time. The current process is as follows: <br /><ul><br /><li>boot the new machine from a CD</li><br /><li>Copy the entire contents of a master disk from another computer</li><br /><li>Go over all configuration files and change them</li><br /><li>Boot the new machine and hope everything works</li><br /></ul><br /><br />This is a horrible way of working. After doing this a couple times I got sick of it as well.<br /><br />Being the lazy guy that I am (or call it efficient if you will), I set out to standardize all our machines.<br /><br />Every machine can be viewed as a collection of hardware and software. The hardware is abstracted by the kernel and the software runs on top of that kernel. So whatever hardware we have the software doesn't care. More about the kernel later.<br />Suppose we have 3 machines. A webserver, a logserver and a monitoringserver. They all run on hardware and have a kernel. On top of this kernel, we run Debian. Debian consists of a number of packages installed. For the webserver for example, we need (obviously) some webserver software (apache), an SSH server to admin the server remotely, some watchdog script to restart the webserver if it crashes, an editor to edit files with, ... etc. The logserver requires a logging service (syslog-ng for example), aswell as a SSH-server, a watchdog, an editor, etc. The same goes for the monitoring server.<br /><br />Now it doesn't take much to realize that most setups are the same except for some small amount of packages. Instead of reinstalling each server from scratch and then installing all the needed packages, we will work with a default server install, a generic server if you will. This install will have an SSH-server, a watchdog, an editor, etc.<br /><br />Now if you want to install a webserver, you need a default install + apache. For a logserver, a default install + syslog-ng, etc.<br /><br />Much and much cleaner and easier to maintain: the setups are largely homogenous and the environment in which you have to work is the same everywhere. Once you install such a server, you need to make sure the separate installations stay in sync with eachother. This means that every time you need something on a certain machine, you should ask yourself if that package should go into the default install or not.<br /><br />All of this can be achieved because of the package management system of this linux distribution. All machines will look alike for the most part. This is because we took the biggest common denominator and made that the standard. The only thing to worry about now is at the lower level: the kernel. <br /><br />The 70 machines we have can be divided in a number of categories. We have Intel machines and AMD machines. Both are rackmountable, but we also have Intel machines that are towermodels.<br />Thus the serverpark consists of 3 machine types. The key differences are processor type and network card brand.<br /><br />The kernel in itself has abstraction layers in itself. It is constructed for the most part, on platform independent code. All platform specific code is in assembler (which is a language to program with the most basic instructions of a processor). The drivers are the same for each processor type because they are written in a higher language ( C ).<br /><br />Anyway, enough with the nerd-talk. Suffice it to say that we need 2 types of kernels for those 3 types of machines. Since we can include the drivers for all networkcards we're gonna use, we only have to worry about the processor type :)<br /><br />[Actually, in our case we also make distinguish between machines who will need NAT functionality and those who don't. This is because of performance issues. So we actually have 4 kinds of kernels: those with intel or amd, and those with or without NAT]<br /><br />I could go on and on about this, but I'm not writing a book about this (yet)<br /><br />Let's skip to the rant shall we ?<br /><br />To accomplish all the above, I am creating a special boot CD based on the Debian install CD. The idea is that you can put the CD in a new machine, boot it up, answer a few questions (like name of machine, IP address and what type of standard server it is going to be, e.g. webserver or logserver or ...), and then the CD would install everything automagically (using debian-installer preseeding).<br />The whole thing wouldn't take more than 15 minutes.<br /><br />I've worked out most of the details.<br />Right now I'm working on the partitioning scheme of the harddisk. On all our servers, we have 3 partitions: a swap partition, a /boot partition and a root partition. All 3 are primary partitions (as opposed to extended/logical partitions)<br />I want to keep up with that way of doing things because it doesn't make sense to do it another way.<br /><br />In order to automatically partition a disk, the Debian installer has a tool called partman-auto. You can tell it what you want your partitioning scheme to look like and it creates it for you.<br /><br />At least, it is supposed to.<br /><br />I can not get the damn thing to create 3 primary partitions. Furthermore, the documentation sucks because it is not complete. The code is largely undocumented. The usage is not intuitive (and doesn't follow the principle of least surprise)...<br /><br />The rest of this text will assume that you know what I'm talking about, because I don't feel like explaining everything :)<br /><br />What I want to do is create 3 partitions in this order:<br />sda1: 2GB swap,<br />sda2: 64MB /boot,<br />sda3: /<br /><br />I tried using the following recipe:<br /><br /><code><br />#    boot-root ::<br />#       2048 2048 200% linux-swap<br />#          $primary{ }<br />#          method{ swap } format{ }<br />#       .<br />#       64 64 64 ext3<br />#          $primary{ } $bootable{ }<br />#          method{ format } format{ }<br />#          use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext3 }<br />#          mountpoint{ /boot }<br />#       .<br />#       500 10000 1000000000 ext3<br />#          $primary{ }<br />#          method{ format } format{ }<br />#          use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext3 }<br />#          mountpoint{ / }<br />#       .<br /></code><br /><br />Notice the $primary{} keyword on every partition. If I use it on all 3 partitions, partman-auto will complain that there are too many primary partitions. However, the partition table allows for 4 partitions so I should be ok.<br />I might be falsely assuming that $primary{} means: allocate a primary partition for this partition. Maybe it means something totally different, but since there is no decent documentation, I cannot tell. I've tried looking at the source of partman-auto (which is written in bash), but I can't make heads or tails of it. One interesting thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem to use any binary ?<br />This would mean that the whole partition thing is done from bash, and I assume through a /dev interface. This is really cool :)<br /><br />Anyway, I would love it if someone could show me an example recipe for 3 partitions that I could reuse. I would also love a better partman-auto package that isn't so obscure and obfuscated [what the fuck is the priority value in the recipes ?? From what I can see from the whacko algorithm to calculate the partition sizes, it is used to calculate a factor for how much a partition is allowed to grow ? If you make the priority equal to the minimum size, then the calculated size will be exactly the minimum size. I can see a use for that, because I want to specify EXACTLY how big my partitions have to be. In any other case, what is the effect of the priority ?] and some more documentation with some example recipes.<br /><br />I'm going to talk to the authors of this thing. I hope they can help. If not, I think it will probably be easier if I program a partitioner myself.<br />

    Many people have tried to convince me of the "superiority" of firefox vs opera.<br />The only difference I see is that firefox has extensions and opera doesn't.<br /><br />Firefox has a lot of extensions, but as far as I know, the functionality provided by the useful extensions, is already implemented in opera anyway, so no need for extensions right ?<br />Still, it would be great to see extensions in opera even if it just to have the option to create your own bloatware for opera too.<br /><br />Every 5 weeks it's my turn to take up what we lovingly call "shit of the week". This includes network problems reported by network admins, firewall rule changes, DNS changes, changing configuration in all kinds of networking gear. We have an internal site with a lot of CGI-scripts to help us do this more efficient (from a browser). The problem I experience is that there are so many different scripts, I don't know which ones are best for what purpose or even if one exists for what I want at all.<br /><br />In an effort to improve efficiency, I had the idea to make a firefox extension to create a smart search. For example, if I'm tracking down problems involving a certain MAC address, the smart search gives me all information it can find about this MAC address. Things like DHCP logs, backbone netflow logs, IP's used with this MAC-address, manufacturer information, ... are all displayed together just by entering a MAC-address.<br /><br />At first I wanted to create a true extension that would have a couple input boxes on some toolbar. After some research I found that extensions in firefox consist mainly of javascript and XUL (some XML stuff to describe GUI widgets). I got sick just by looking at it all.<br /><br />So instead of an extension, I created an extra search engine and added it to the search-box in firefox. I created a .src file too and a page where people from my unit can click on a link to install the new search engine.<br />The search engine is rather simple. Type in anything and it gets sent to a CGI on an internal webserver. That CGI will determine what kind of info you are looking for and will show the appropriate information in frames (I'm lazy and I just want to link to other CGI's ok ;)<br />together with a frame that has links to all the CGI's, in case the search engine interpreted wrong.<br /><br />It looks really great and handy, although I haven't tested it yet in practice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I hardly ever use firefox and I wasn't looking forward to having to use firefox all of the time.<br />So I googled around this morning, looking to see if there really aren't any extensions for opera.<br />I found a page that explains how to <a href='http://www.schrode.net/opera/search/search_ini.html'>add search engines in opera</a> and <a href='http://people.opera.com/rijk/opera/searchbuttons.html'>another one</a><br />I added my search-engine and it works !<br /><br />Again unfortunately, the <a href='http://www.opera.com/support/search/supsearch.dml?index=351'>opera support site says</a>:<br /><br /><code><br />Opera comes with a default list of search engines, stored in a file called "search.ini". It is possible to edit this file to change or add searches, but this is an unsupported feature, and Opera will usually overwrite custom search.ini files when you upgrade to a new version, to ensure that the list of search engines is correct.<br /></code><br /><br />No matter what features firefox has to offer, I still keep finding ways to keep using opera :)<br />

    One of the things I want to do this year is go to a music festival. The one I had in mind has a site at <a href='http://www.rockwerchter.be/'>http://www.rockwerchter.be/</a>.<br />So I go there, and to my surprise it runs some crappy flash intro page. I don't want this junk in my <a href='http://www.opera.com/'>Opera</a> browser so I start <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/'>firefox</a> because I installed some flashplayer in it for these special occasions (and to prove that even firefox crashes when using a sucky extension like Flash)<br /><br />...<br /><br />Nothing happens.<br />I get an empty page. How could this be ? Maybe because I upgraded to the latest firefox version (1.5)  some time ago ? I check all menu's in firefox to see if I can look at what is causing the problem: nothing. No mention of plugins anywhere, nothing in the extensions menu.<br />So where is it ?<br />Anyway, I figure that, because I upgraded firefox, maybe I also need to upgrade the flash plugin. I go to the site for that and install it (after first having to figure out where to put it)<br />I close all firefox windows, start it up again, go to the site: nothing. Still.<br /><br />Hmm interesting.<br /><br />I start firefox from console, to see if it spews any errors. And indeed, it has some problem with the sound:<br /><br /><code><br />** (swfdec-mozilla-player:8464): WARNING **: No GConf default audio sink key and osssink doesn't work<br />Could not create audio sink<br /></code><br /><br />Whatever that means.<br />I kill off my radio-steam playing in the background and try again: same error.<br /><br />Time to google. (realtime)<br />I find some reference to gstreamer-properties. When I execute it, it says I can chose between 2 audiosinks. Neither works.<br /><br />After installing gstreamer0.8-artsd, I can chose "artsd" in the gstreamer-properties.<br />I ask for a test, but the thing crashes.<br /><br />Anyway, lets see if firefox still does nothing.<br /><br />Aha! it works now, although without sound, but who cares anyway ? I don't need to watch some stupid flash animation.<br />FLASH SUCKS<br /><br />When are people going to realise that the internet is not a cartoon animation ? USE HTML damnit.<br /><br />All of this just to see that the ticket sale hasn't started yet.<br /><br />Flash just pisses me off. I believe everyone who assumes people want to look at pointless flash animations or "intro pages" should be shot.<br />Really, have you ever seen a useful flash application ? The ones I've seen are: games, intro pages or entire sites coded in flash.<br /><br />Oh and if you read this and you made a c00l flash animation. DO YOU HAVE A HTML LINK TO YOUR CONTENT ?? The times I've had to look at the stupid flash intro just so I could click on a "skip intro" link. Or even worse, animations without "skip intro".<br /><br />Should I name a few of the thousands of reasons why flash sucks ? First, you need a plugin that makes your browser crash 50% of the time. Next, you can't use the search function in flash. It is a proprietary format meaning you need to BUY software to make a flash animation and you need to reverse engineer a (possibly) changing fileformat to make players for it. You can't bookmark it and you can't print it. And most of all, I've never seen anything made in flash that's actually useful and couldn't have been made in plain HTML or in a java applet.<br /><br />To my great disgust, the KULeuven is now recruiting flash-animators for god knows what reason.<br />I hope they won't start with this shit.

        weekend

    <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2006</span>

    I had an appointment with the cutest fitness instructor last friday. My schedule got upgraded, basically from 2 sequences of 12 repetitions to 3 of 15. Besides that, I'm now working on a whole new set of machines. When I came home friday I got a sick feeling and almost couldn't move. I like it :) With my previous schedule I had the same thing. The first 3-4 times I was dead after each visit to the fitness center. But not (after 20 or so sessions), I find most excersises easy.<br /><br />This weekend I found the battery of my car is dead and the flat tire is back. That all sucks.<br />To top it off, our rustfree BBQ is starting to rust...<br /><br />I spent the rest of the weekend washing, drying and folding all of my laundry, which is about every piece of clothing I own (I know I know, I should do more laundry, but its not one of my top-5 most favourite activites)<br />While doing laundry I also cleaned up my room.<br /><br />For some reason I totally missed the planned PullThePlug meeting. I was hoping the meeting would get cancelled, but who am I kidding ;) I'm not that indispensible.<br /><br />On sunday I went to a computer fair. It sucked. I remember computer fairs with lots and lots of exotic hardware. No such stuff at this fair, nono. There was mostly new hardware, printing paper, printer ink, CD's/DVD's, jewelry(!), toys(!), VCR's(!) and all kinds of other crap that doesn't belong at a COMPUTER FAIR. Besides all that, a hotdog cost 3 euro and a cola 2 euro. Whoever organised this: you suck.<br /><br />In other news, the world went nuts last week over some cartoons.<br /><a href='http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/02/05/we_are_all_danes_now/'>http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/02/05/we_are_all_danes_now/</a>.<br />I'm not sure what to think of all this. I suppose it was something waiting to happen. I sure hope the western world doesn't cave to the Muslim demands, because it would compromise the freedoms we like to promote so much. I don't understand what is so bad about a couple cartoons, even if they show their prophet. I wish they would be a bit more openminded and less long-toe-d. An act of freedom of speech should not invoke such a violent reaction. Maybe all the muslims need is a fresh can of ability to relativate.<br /><br />I've heard some interesting stuff from things happening in Belgium. Apparently the AEL (Arabic European Liga) has published a number of cartoons as a reaction to the cartoons of Mohammed. They supposedly imply that the holocaust never happened, and some jokes about germans and jews.<br /><br />...<br /><br />FINALLY! :) Someone breaks the goddamn silence on this crap. People are too uptight. Do you know there is a law in Belgium that you can't declare the holocaust didn't happen ? I suppose it hurts the feelings of everyone who was in a concentration camp ? Or their children or relatives ? Well guess what: suck it up. I wish we wouldn't make laws about freedom of speech, and then change them when we see fit. If you want freedom, then you should accept that others have it too.

        WTF is democracy anyway ?

    <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2006</span>

    You've got to admire Belgian politics.<br /><br />There's a whole fuss about some commentary our king made in his newyears-speech about the separatism between north and south. The fuss is about whether the king should be allowed to make such commentary. Since the king is not supposed to get involved in politics, it all boils down to whether this is in fact a political remark (to me).<br /><br />Anyway, the prime minister (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt">Verhofstadt</a>) commented on it saying that the whole fuss is a typical thing by the right wing. (Of course I can't find anything in the online newspapers about this speech by the prime minister)<br />By saying this he shut up the entire room, because anyone who would comment on it would be labelled as being sympathetic with the right wing, something that seems to be worse than getting AIDS in this country.<br /><br />This all looks like the PM is trying to make himself more popular by taking a cheap shot at the right wing, something that seems to be "groovy" today.<br />I commented on that to nixe saying that he (Verhofstadt) should watch out, because some people might be offended and actually vote for the right wing (Since the PM labels them as that anyway)<br /><br />We (me and nixe) got into a heated debate about how a lot of the votes for the right wing actually being protest votes and how the right wing should never be allowed to get a majority in our governement because they are fascists.<br /><br />Let me situate Belgian politics to you for a moment.<br /><br />We have a rightwing party called "Vlaams Blok" (VB) who got a lot of votes at the start of the 1990s. It was so bad for the other political parties that that specific election-day was named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_zondag">"Black Sunday"</a>.<br />A year later, all political parties (re-)agreed to never work together with the VB. This agreement is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire">"Cordon Sanitaire"</a>.<br />What happened in the years after that ? (According to what I believe of course) Because VB already had a large amount of votes (17% or so), the rest of the political parties had to make larger and larger coalitions. The government was no longer in any position to govern efficiently because too many parties and too many opinions were involved. They debated about stupid arguments and never got to a consensus. All of this created a political disgust among the public. Because most of the big political parties were already in the governing coalition, they could not express their dissatisfaction with the way things were going. That's why a lot of people started voting on the VB as a form of protest. (Oh hey, here's an idea: Instead of nagging on, going back and forward as to whether the people voting on the VB are actually voting for them or just protesting, maybe you could change the voting procedure ? What about a small box that says "Check this if you want to file a protest vote". VB would lose votes instantly with this, no ? And we would have an idea about how many citizens are dissatisfied with current affairs. I should suggest this to a senator) <br /><br />Now because of the Cordon Sanitaire, this only kept getting worse untill a couple of years ago. The government tried some sneaky stuff to get VB booted, like getting the VB convicted for rascism. As a reaction to that, the VB changed its name from Vlaams Blok to Vlaams Belang, hereby clearing the charges (because they formed a new party). Then there were issues with taking away the funding for this new party because they didn't actually get any votes yet, they took over the ones from Vlaams Blok. (Which makes me wonder: most other parties had a renaming frenzy a couple years before that. Why would their funding not be taken away ? Because they renamed instead of starting a new party ?)<br /><br />So OK, what do we have now ? VB has <a href="http://www.vlaamsparlement.be/">32 out of 124 seats in the flemish parliament</a>. This is more than 25%.<br />VB also has <a href="http://verkiezingen2004.belgium.be/nl/eur/results/results_tab_etop.html">14.34% of votes on the federal level</a>, which is the second best score (The best is 17.43% by the CD&V + NVA cartel. This makes the claim by the VB that they are the largest PARTY in Belgium, true. Since the CD&V+NVA cartel is not a party ;) but thats a sidenote). The political party with the most votes gets to assemble a coalition for the government. If the VB is in that position, they would be in the government but noone would want to govern with them (or so they say, because I believe most politicians are just greedy slimy money-eating machines who would sell their kids just to have the "Minister" title)<br /><br />These results are disturbing and are probably caused by the same Cordon Sanitaire that tried to keep the VB out of the government in the first place.<br /><br />The other political parties are afraid, and they should be. They were childish when they thought they could "control" the government without the support of the public, by making arrangements to keep their asses safe.<br /><br />The other political parties refer to themselves as "democratic parties", implicitly naming the VB undemocratic. I wonder what gives them that right. The VB has not been in the government yet, but the other political parties have. They are the ones trying to censor the VB and they call themselves democratic ? Hellooo, give these people a dictionary!<br /><br />I believe in true democracy. The people should govern themselves. For that, everyone needs to be able to speak up and get heard. When you start censoring or blocking out a big part of a population, you take away their right to get heard, and thus you break democracy.<br />Many people believe I'm some kind of promotor for VB, some even say that I'm a rascist because of that. I'm neither. I believe in free speech and freedom for all. I don't discriminate. If any other party should be mistreated, I would defend them as well.<br /><br />I believe that VB should be heard, not ridiculed. I know they are only a (big) minority, but they are citizens of this country damnit. What you should under no circumstances do in a democracy, is let the majority supress a minority of the population, no matter what their beliefs are. As long as they harm noone and only utter political ideas, don't touch them. They have free speech!<br /><br />If you allow a majority to supress a minority, we all know what happens but are afraid to say it in this context. We've had witchhunts, crusades and genocide in our history. We don't need to go on with this. If you really truly believe in democracy like I do, then don't try to control the process. Don't take away people's freedom to form a party, vote on who they want, say what they want.<br /><br />I will be a geek for posting this, but I think this quote from Star Trek is really appropriate:<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard">"With the first link, a chain is forged. The first speech censured, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably."</a> -- J.L. Picard<br /><br />This quote is from an episode called <a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TNG/episode/68496.html">"The Drumhead" in "StarTrek The Next Generation"</a>. If you haven't seen it yet, I advise you to look at it. StarTrek is more than spaceships and aliens. If you open your mind and look beyond the superficial layer of science-fiction, you'll see that you can find a lot of meaningful things in there.
