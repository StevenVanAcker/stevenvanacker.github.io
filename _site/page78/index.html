    We're past the firstmile stone now :) 10km straight.<br />An interesting sensation afterwards. My legs felt like they were not there at all.<br />I'm not sure I could have done much more than 25 laps, but I'm sure I'll get to 50 at some point.<br />Running 12 is now a breeze and in time, so will 25 be.

    Today I wanted to play with serial console a bit, because it doesn't work like I want it to.<br />So I started VMWare and started installing debian with the installation CD.<br />To my surprise, the installation fubars.<br /><br />It appears that the locales package panics when it tries to generate locale for the "en" locale. Which is normal because it doesn't exist.<br />I don't remember ever telling debian to use that locale ?<br /><br />So I started tracking the problem. There is a file /etc/locale.gen which contains a list of locales to work with. This file is generated at installation time by the locales package. The input for that generation process comes from the languagechooser udeb(?) in the debian-installer.<br />This last one parser a file /usr/share/languagelist and extracts the entry for the "English" language, which is:<br /><pre><br />English;en;en_US@euro;en;US;en_US:en_GB:en;kbd=lat0-sun16(iso15)<br /></pre><br /><br />The /usr/bin/languagemap then extracts the second value "en" from that list and that is used as the locale later on.<br /><br />OK, I know the CD hasn't changed, but the locales package might have.<br /><br />So what is actually erroring in there that didn't error before ?<br />The postinst script calls /usr/bin/locale-gen which reads /etc/locale.gen and calls "localedef" on it.<br />That generates an error:<br /><pre><br />cannot open local definition file 'en': No such file or directory<br /></pre><br /><br /><pre><br />(deepstar/tachyon) ~$ strace -s 1500 -ifo /tmp/localedef.log localedef -i en -c -f ISO-8859-1 -A /etc/locale.alias en<br />cannot open locale definition file `en': No such file or directory<br />(deepstar/tachyon) ~$ cat /tmp/localedef.log |grep i18n<br />10009 [b7f2b09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/charmaps/ISO-8859-1", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br />10009 [b7f2b09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/charmaps/ISO-8859-1.gz", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10009 [b7f2b09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/en", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br />(deepstar/tachyon) ~$ strace -s 1500 -ifo /tmp/localedef.log localedef -i en_US -c -f ISO-8859-1 -A /etc/locale.alias en_US<br />cannot open locale archive "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive": Permission denied<br />(deepstar/tachyon) ~$ cat /tmp/localedef.log |grep i18n<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/charmaps/ISO-8859-1", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/charmaps/ISO-8859-1.gz", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("i18n", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/i18n", O_RDONLY) = 4<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/iso14651_t1", O_RDONLY) = 4<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_neutral", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_circle", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_cjk_compat", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_compat", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_font", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_fraction", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_narrow", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_small", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />10018 [b7ebd09e] open("/usr/share/i18n/locales/translit_wide", O_RDONLY) = 3<br />(deepstar/tachyon) ~$ <br /></pre><br /><br />From this strace, I conclude that localedef looks for /usr/share/i18n/locales/en and doesn't find it.<br /><br />When I try installing Debian without modifications, the locale is set to en_US, which is puzzling.<br />Somehow, the custom CD sets locale to en, and does it differently from standard Debian. I don't recall modifying anything that could touch it though.<br /><br />Instead of figuring out what settings I need to fix to make this problem go away, I'll just overwrite /etc/environment from within the debian installer.<br />The correct file to change is /usr/lib/prebaseconfig.d/05languagechooser<br />

    I attached the subwoofer with some cabling-voodoo and am happy with the result.<br /><br />Also, I did some more work on the drupal theme to improve it. I might decide to go with a totally new design in the end, since some people complained that the theme "sucked". Especially the colors...

    The end-result of cleaning is a clean room or house.<br />It's too bad that cleaning takes so much time though.<br /><br />I've cleaned out my entire room. All my furniture was out of there, I cleaned with my new vacuum cleaner, threw a whole lot of stuff out and now everything is shining clean.<br /><br />Because I got sick of cleaning from time to time, I started working on a decent theme for this site. It's not final yet :) Instead, this is the theme I've created for a new site I'm working on. More details when its finished.<br /><br />While cleaning, I found a box with some birthday-stuff in it I wanted to send to a former friend (definitely post stage 5 by now, for at least 1.5 years). I've done the effort of looking up her home address, but the box is still here. Why ?<br /><br />I remember a similar incident with a former friend 7 years ago. Her gift never left either...<br /><br />Maybe I thought "why bother ?". Why would they care that I went throught the trouble of putting thought in a gift, buying and wrapping it ? If they don't want to keep contact, are they worth it ?<br /><br />I place a lot of value in little things. I've kept an empty carton of cigarettes in my drawer for years, because someone I knew wrote a message on it for me while at a pub. I have a little bag of tea hanging on my wall, reminding me of a promise someone once made to drink tea together. I still have the key from someone's bike, she borrowed it to me because I was kind enough to fix her broken wheel, but never asked the key back...<br /><br />Should I throw it all out ? Memories of failed friendships, like splinters in my eye. Staples perforating my heart... if I pull them out, will the bleeding ever stop ?<br />

    It's easy to get up in the morning when you have something to look forward too.<br />Today I had a couple things planned.<br /><br />I got up at 7.30 and watched some TV till 8am.<br />Then I replaced all 4 tires of my car with the spare ones (I had wide tires mounted, but one of them has a leak)<br />It took me 49 minutes (!)<br /><br />Now I'm researching how I can put the CD-player in my car instead of the cassette-deck.<br /><br />In case I lose the information, here it is:<br /><br /><pre><br />Clarion DRB 4275 CD player.<br />Power: <br />  black: ground<br />  red: after contact (permanent)<br />  orange: lights<br />  blue: automatic antenna<br />  yellow: memory (after key) (?)<br />Speakers:<br />  brown: right rear +<br />  brown/white: right rear -<br />  grey: right front +<br />  grey/black: right front -<br />  white: left front +<br />  white/black: left front -<br />  green: left rear +<br />  green/black: left rear -<br /></pre><br /><br />On the internetz, I found the following:<br /><pre><br />Gray=right front+<br />Gray/Black=right front-<br />Green=left rear+<br />Green/Black=left rear-<br />Violet=right rear+<br />Violet/Black=right rear-<br />POWER ACCESSORY<br />Yellow 14ga=battery main/memory<br />Yellow 18ga=batteryCeNet power/memory<br />Red=accessory(ignition on)<br />Black=ground<br />Blue=Antenna turn on+<br />Blue/White=remote turn on (amps)+<br />Orange/White=dimmer<br />Brown=phone mute<br />Orange=parking brake video lockout<br />White/Red=CCD(camera)input instant on<br /></pre><br /><br />It doesn't describe what I'm seeing on my CD-player, but I noticed the page was 404 and already in google cache ;) So I mirror it for your pleasure.<br /><br />When I looked at the CD-player, I also noticed that the orange cable is not connected to a pin.<br /><br />Ok, it's now 11.25am.<br />I've canibalised the cassette deck, cut all its wires and connected the CD-player. The connector for the antenna was broken in my car, so I had to fix it.<br />I sacrifised a couple of nails, a red marker, a coathanger, some matches and lots of tape to rebuild the connector.<br /><br />And now I have sound in my car ! :) Both CD's and radio work well.<br />Unfortunately, the huge subwoofer in my trunk is not doing anything.<br />I should look into it later.<br /><br />When I first switched on the CD-player, it started playing music. It appears the previous owner (my grandfather) forgot to take out the CD :)<br />It's a Frank Sinatra CD and not really my kind of music. I'll return it first chance I get.<br /><br />It's now 8.14PM<br />I've made a bread, from scratch and its huge :)<br />It looks like it went really well too. I'll have a taste tonight.<br />While the bread was in the oven, I dug out 2 trees in the backyard. They were in the way for my next plan: a parallel parking excercise to practice on.<br /><br />When (not if) I'm good at parallel parking and the other maneuvers, I'll go back to the driving school and ask a couple lessons after which I'll take my drivers exam again
