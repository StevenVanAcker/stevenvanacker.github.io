  <h1 class="post-title">New year's resolutions 2011</h1>
  <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2011</span>
  For some reason, my resolutions for a new year mostly get implemented without any active work by me.<br />It's quite odd. Maybe I am aware of these objectives subconsiously ? Let's hope that this trend continues!<br /><br />My newyear's resolutions for 2011 (in no particular order):<br /><dl><br /><dt>Build the wargame for HES2011</dt><br /><dd>Apparently, the <a href="http://hes2010.labs.overthewire.org">HES2010 wargame</a> that I created last year was an overwhelming success. So much so that a lot of people have asked me to create the wargame for <a href="http://www.hackitoergosum.org">HES2011</a> too. I was already working on it of course, but it's still nice that people request it explicitely ;)<br /></dd><br /><dt>Eat less meat!</dt><br /><dd>At the Dranouter festival in August 2010, I saw an interesting presentation from a guy who said that if everyone would be a vegetarian half of the time, that would be the same as half the population being a vegetarian. Less animals get killed and noone has to stop eating meat completely. A very appealing thought! So, I will make an attempt at eating less meat. Maybe I can participate in the <a href="http://www.donderdagveggiedag.be">"Vegetarian Thursday"</a> initiative</dd><br /><dt>Visit Australia</dt><br /><dd>If I have enough vacation days that is... I would like to visit Australia and meet up with some friends there. Maybe I can go to Ruxcon 2011 :)</dd><br /><dt>Continue work on my CNC machine</dt><br /><dt>Do some decent work on my PhD</dt><br /><dt>Find a new house</dt><br /><dt>Release information on my master thesis from last year</dt><br /><dt>play more party games</dt><br /></dl>
