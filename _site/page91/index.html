    There was a discussion on the pulltheplug chat today about how sucky the security of <a href='http://www.rosiello.net'>Rosiello products</a> is. One thing let to the other and some <a href='http://www.rosiello.net/shirts/'>links to pictures</a> were pasted.<br /><br />Then, a first (to my knowledge) PTP Photoshop contest was launched, and I entered this picture:<br /><br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1017698|thumb=1|alt=6110_large.jpg]<br /><br />While I was editing this blog, I noticed an error in the changes I made to the img_assist module. It would not show all the pictures I wanted. I'm gonna look into it more closely and submit the changes to the drupal.org site again.<br />

    Happy newyear<br /><br />I've been lazy with my blog again and I have a lot of catching up todo. I could apologize, but it doesn't matter. Being lazy is becoming a trademark of mine, aswell as being late with blogging. Maybe it should be one of my 13 almighty works...<br /><br />I can't even remember when I wrote my last blog, but I can see it was about the new laptop and that was right before christmas.<br />Thanks to the nice burglars I don't have pictures of our christmas party. We started the party around 6PM, but before we could cook anything at all, we had to clean up the kitchen and do the dishes. That took 2 hours or so and will teach us in the future (and I will look for a way to put this in bold red blinking text) to <em>KEEP THE KITCHEN CLEAN AT ALL TIMES</em><br />Due to bad planning we had only finished the main course around 1AM. At that time I went to bed because I was too tired to wait for dessert.<br /><br />I went to my parents home for the first time in months. It's something I should do more often, but I have no good incentive to do it :( I find it hard to go there because I don't know what to expect. Most of the times, it feels good. My family likes me even when I think they don't. I can see sadness in their eyes when I leave, something I should remind myself of from time to time...<br /><br />I have no pictures of 22c3. Most of the interesting talks were similar to 21c3. I found time there to fix my laptop. I managed to get wireless networking working, my graphics card with 3D support, the infrared driver and encrypted disk support. I brought back a 22c3 sweater and a tough cold.<br /><br />The cold ruined my oldyear-to-newyear party for pretty much everyone invited. I was in some weird hazy state and I can't say how thankful I am for all the help my friends provided. You know what its like when you're ill, you sit there and see things around you moving but you don't really realize it. It's like you're in another place, deep inside your own body looking through your own eyes but not able to interact, everyone and everything seems kilometers away...<br />I watched as my friends started making dinner, cleaning the place up and pretty much do everything I should have been doing. This is probably what "I'll be there for you" means in the Friends themesong. <br /><br />What are the properties of true friends ? Is it that they can discuss things with you, respecting your ideas while explaining their own ? Is it that they accept you as you are, dispite all your bad sides ? Is it the undefined sense of implicit trust you feel when you're around them ? Knowing you can depend on your friends without having to ask ?<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />In computer security, trust is very expensive commodity. The default behaviour is to trust nothing and only trust people when it can be mathematically calculated that they can be trusted. Many mathematical principles can be mapped onto computer trust. Since math is never wrong, your trust is never misplaced. Unfortunately, the real world is not perfect and I have been mistaken.<br /><br />People are not computers. They can not prove they can be trusted, but only that they can not be trusted. It's totally opposite to all I know. How to trust people ? There should be a Book of Trust... Clearly, not trusting anyone is the wrong way to go. If you trust noone, life is very difficult. You can not count on anyone, can't share ideas or (god forbid) feelings. You end up being alone among others.<br /><br />I imagine that learning how to trust people is a process that starts when you are very young. Weak friendships formed and broken, trust shared and betrayed, getting hurt a lot. Among the chaos and pain, a heuristic is formed, a gut feeling: can this person be trusted ?<br /><br />I learned very late that there is no such thing as absolute trust. Most people can be trusted only as far as you can throw them, literally. Maybe that's what differs real friends from "people I know"<br /><br />It must be a good feeling to know that you can offload what is on your mind to your friends and absolutely know that it will not end up on the proverbial 6 o'clock news. That's what trust is about for me.<br /><br />Friends, extensions of our soul, helping to carry the burden of shared thoughts, standing shoulder to shoulder prepared and equipped to handle whatever comes down the road of life, together.<br />

        A brand new laptop
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2005</span>

    The laptop I was waiting for found its way to my desk last week. I had a Dell Windows recover CD, which I thought would help me install everything.<br /><br />So I installed Windows first, only to see then that the CD doesn't come with drivers. No network drivers... I felt like a caveman. What is a computer without network ?<br />I ended up installing Linux sooner than expected, just so I could download the drivers in Windows.<br /><br />Anyway, I have my new laptop. It has 1GB RAM and a ATI Radeon X300 graphics card. It also came without CD-drive but with an extra battery in its drive-bay. I'm not complaining :) I still had the CDRW/DVD-ROM combo drive from the stolen laptop. This drive was delivered by Dell by mistake. We had ordered a DVDRW drive and after they sent it, they didn't come back to pick up the combo drive. All in my favor.<br /><br />I've installed the Quake 4 demo and the Call of Duty 2 demo on my laptop. Both run very nice :)<br />But now the time has come for installing codecs...<br /><br />I get a sickening feeling when I think of Windows and Codecs at the same time and I hope I won't puke all over my laptop because of it, while typing this...<br /><br />Last time I installed the ACE Mega CoDecS pack and everything seemed to work after that. So thats where I start from again. I looked up where I can download it and was presented with <a href="http://www.divx-digest.com/software/acemega_codec.html">this</a> site. Note how it says: <br /><br /><code><br />Suggestion : In most situations, you do not need to install codec/filter packs and certainly not every codec/filter that comes with these packs. In fact, you may run into problems if you install too many codec/filters on your computer. It is Highly recommended that you only install the codec/filters that you absolutely need.<br /></code><br /><br />Well how nice. So I don't have to install everything. But then, what DO I have to install ?<br />Why are there so many codecs to begin with ? As Andrew Tanenbaum once said: <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum/">The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from</a><br /><br />So, how can I find out which codecs to install ? I look around the site some more, hoping to find a FAQ. Instead, I find the next best thing: a <a href="http://forum.digital-digest.com/">forum</a>.<br /><br />Right there, in the "Video & Audio Codecs" section, the first sticky note helps me.<br /><code><br />Determine the codec for your .AVI files <br /><br />If you are running into problems playing back your AVI file, especially if you are getting the dreaded "codec not found" error, then you should try afreeCodecVT, a free software produced by the very moderator of this forum. afreeCodecVT allows you to load in an AVI file, and it will tell you which video/audio codecs are needed to playback this file and also where to download the codec:<br /><br />http://www.afreecodec.com/?page=/details.php%3Fid%3D60<br /></code><br /><br />Let's install <a href="http://www.afreecodec.com/?page=/details.php%3Fid%3D60">that</a><br />First it complains that Visual Basic runtime files are out of date. Luckily it doesn't panic and start formatting my harddrive or anything. Instead, it install pretty nicely. Afterwards it tells me that the software will update itself automagically. Very nice... when reading it. I wonder if the good news will hold up in practice.<br /><br />I already don't like this tool.<br />I comes with its own type of widgets, meaning it doesn't even look like a Windows program. It's all in black, with custom controles. Blah. I'm not sure if it's this program or my new mouse, but after every click, I can't click on anything in the program. I have to switch to another program and then back, just to get mouse focus. This is gonna suck. Anyway, I managed to load an AVI file. I says I need and MP3 audio codec and XviD MPEG4 codec.<br /><br />...<br />Genius !<br />I was typing in this window (and had typed quite a lot) when I wanted to see hidden files and folders, and see the extensions on all files. Windows then went on to refresh THIS window and erase all of my text. GODDAMNIT<br /><br />So what happened: I clicked on the MP3 audio codec link in the afreecodec program, it loaded a site over this window (I complained about that but it got erased...). I downloaded it, it was in RAR. I then downloaded ExtractNow and had to manually associate all archiving formats with it. Then I extracted the archive, which contained a read.me file (not readme.txt mind you, that would have been too convenient)<br /><br />I started reg.bat after seeing what it does (registered an .ax file)<br />Now I should be set for audio.<br /><br />Next is the video codec...<br />done. (no details, the program once again opened its site in this window)<br /><br />I should now be able to play this AVI. And it works! Except that it uses the horrible Windows Media Player by default. That has got to change. I've grown quite fond of <a href="http://www.bsplayer.org/">BSPlayer</a> in Windows. A disturbing fact arises: BSPlayer now has a Pro version which is BUY-Ware. I don't like this development and I hope it will not affect the quality of BSPlayer in the future...

    Life without a laptop sure is different. Or should I say "life without a computer", since I have none left. <br /><br />I broke my record again on saturday: 1031KCal. After that, I did 4 machines of laundry (!) and improvised stuff to dry my clothes (unfortunately, no pictures of that, you can thank the burglars for that)<br />We're making plans to install an intrusion detection system. More information on that later I suppose, as I wouldn't want to give any details away to you lurking burglars.<br />The police asked me to contact the owner of the house so he could fill out a statement and send it back to the police. Since we can't reach the owner directly, I had to contact his representative (which happens to be a lawyer) He was not available in the weekend, and not yesterday morning. I managed to get a hold of him at noon and he told me some juridical stuff of which I couldn't make any sense. Then he told me he would have to contact some courtroom and told me that I should contact HIM later.<br /><br />Ok, what the hell ? I tried to call him a couple of hours later, but no answer.<br />So far, I'm not liking this guy a lot. We'll see if he answers today...<br /><br />I might be able to get a laptop by the end of the week. It would also be a Dell D610, but with 1GB RAM instead of 512MB and an ATI Radeon X300 instead of the crappy Intel 915GM card I had.<br />So far, so good :) This laptop would be better than the stolen one, except that it doesn't have a DVD-RW :(<br />But that could get fixed I suppose. For now, I can put in the CDRW/DVD combo drive Dell sent us first in error. They never came to pick them up, so yay<br /><br />Quite not to my surprise, ULYSSIS mailed back today that they won't put the Ekonomika server in front of their firewall. This is sad news, but I can't say its illogical. I couldn't believe they said "yes" at first, because if I were still in ULYSSIS, I would have never allowed it. It sets a precedent for other servers and doesn't make ULYSSIS look good.<br />So, the Ekonomika server will still be dependant on the services of ULYSSIS (firewall and switches). In the event of a powerfailure, a UPS would have to power all those to keep Ekonomika online. Since the Ekonomika board-of-directors hasn't decided yet whether they will pay for the 1500VA UPS I had in mind, I should probably consider other options. I will put a page online with the status of Ekonomika and the ULYSSIS network, but obviously not on a server on the ULYSSIS network.<br /><br />Also, this year I would like to be in time with my Christmas cards. I'm currently writing them and I have good hopes that they will be delivered in time ;) (If the Postal service cooperates...)<br />

        Burglarized!

    <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2005</span>

    I get up this morning and go downstairs. Even before I noticed the window was open, I noticed my laptop is missing (how could I not ? It had 2 cool stickers on it, one from 21c3 "Usual Suspect" and one from Microsoft "Trained in the art of network defense")<br /><br />As it turns out, we've been burglarized. Some turd broke into the back of our house and took my laptop (complete with backpack and power adapter), my digital camera (which was in my jacket in the hallway) and 10 euro from Noot's wallet. I must admit they were really quiet and they at least didn't wake us up in the middle of the night (which would have pissed me off), but they didn't even bother to wipe their feet when they entered, and didn't even do the dishes. Bah!<br /><br />This all reminds me of a <a href='http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=chicken_shit'>story of maddox</a> where he warns burglars what will happen to them if he meets them ;)<br /><br />So anyway, the police was patrolling in the street, so I ran after them. They took notes and said they would call when they knew more. I still have to send them the serial number of the laptop and the camera. While they were taking notes, other calls came in of burglaries in our street. As far as I know there have been at least 3 burglaries in our street this night.<br /><br />Besides securing data I should maybe look into securing my home aswell. I plan to install a couple of nightvision webcams that detect movement at night and take pictures which are sent to a secure location.<br /><br />As always, it pays of to know things about computers. I've been able to dig up from the logs when my computer was unplugged from the network. Somewhere around 4.48 and 4.53am (DHCP renew is set to 5 minutes and the last entry is at 4.48am). I'm not sure how this can help the police, but I will inform them of this when I send my serial numbers.<br /><br />I consider my possessions lost, including all my data. It's a sad thing that I was not prepared for this. Backup facilities are free at work, I could have easily taken a backup. My employer (KULeuven) has insurance for this kind of thing and (according to my boss) they will take care of it. When I think of it, I didn't pay for either my laptop (from work) or my camera (bought with the money I got from doing volunteer work for Ekonomika). The only thing I paid for were the rechargable batteries and the 256MB SD-card in my camera.<br /><br />Going to 22c3 suddenly lost some of its magic since I will probably not have a laptop with me then.<br />But I guess I'll manage. Last year I didn't have a laptop either, and I listened to a lot of talks instead of working on some cool projects or wargames :)<br /><br />Oh! Speaking of wargames. I solved the <a href='http://www.pulltheplug.org/newfu/?q=node/9'>nemo1.c challenge</a> and wrote a solution for it. Luckily, I finished and submitted it last, before my laptop got stolen.<br /><br />I wonder what a builtin (in the laptop) GPS-system with GPRS or similar costs...
