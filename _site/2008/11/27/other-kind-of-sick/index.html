  <!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br /><a href="//2008/09/15/vicks-vitamin-c-anti-viral-tissues-lots/">Some time ago</a> I logged the symptoms of a cold to have a reference in the future about how long my colds last.

Feeling alone and socially isolated, noone to talk to or be around. Its range goes from a very tiny little feeling to the Great Mental Collapse of '98 which was worse by 4 or 5 orders of magnitude (base 10).

At times it feels like nothing I do matters at all and that I might just aswell sit in front of a TV like a sack of potatoes.

I start to question my kindness and begin to believe that people are abusing it all the time.<br /><br />And in general, I become too serious about things and noone wants to talk to me when I'm serious (unless I'm doing an exam of course), which reinforces my thoughts and that all becomes a self-fulfilling thing.</dd><br /><br /><dt>Being in a bad mood</dt><br /><dd>When I'm in a bad mood, I get mad easily.

In it's worst stage, I want to hurt people and destroy things. This hasn't happened before because I really do have self-control.
