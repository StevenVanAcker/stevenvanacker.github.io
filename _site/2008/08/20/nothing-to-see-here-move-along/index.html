It turns out that setting up scponlyc becomes increasingly more and more complex as you're looking at the details. I don't mind setting up a chroot, but not with the script provided with the scponly package (since it starts adding users with useradd instead of adduser..., that's 2 undesireable things already). And I guess I can live with it that users see the entire chroot directory structure when they use scponly, although it probably is not necessary: I'm suren there's a way to hide all of those directories in files, only to make things even more complex.
