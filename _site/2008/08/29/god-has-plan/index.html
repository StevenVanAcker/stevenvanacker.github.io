  <!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />The last time I prayed and believed it, was when I was 11. I sat down with my brother and we prayed all night long, hoping it would save one of my other brothers' life. It didn't. He died a couple of days later.<br /><br />I stopped believing in God right there and then and I've been very sceptic about it ever since. It is much more effective to be kind and be a light in the tunnel for those who need it, instead of believing that some superhuman creature will take care of you if you speak to it often enough.<br /><br />This week I had some time to fix the server and network of the American College in Leuven. I have been maintaining only the mail- and webserver for some years now and it was time for an upgrade and a make-over. After upgrading the server and setting a new secure password policy, I had a look at the wireless accesspoints and found out that it wasn't secure at all: for years, neighbours had been taking advantage of the open accesspoints to download all kinds of crap.<br />Well, I took care of that. All of those APs are now secure as well.<br /><br />The reason why I like helping out the ACL, is because the people there are so kind. All of the people there are religious, and some of them might actually be priests, I don't know. The reason I don't know is because they act like regular people. Unlike the priests (and religion teachers!) I had met previously, they were not constantly preaching about Jesus, God and all the magic anecdotes from the bible.<br /><br />Anyway, they are building some kind of podium in their chapel and I was interested in that. During one of my conversations, father Mahar mentionend that they had had a mass in the chapel that day for me, to thank God for bringing me into their lives.<br /><br />And I was overwhelmed by that. That's one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.<br />Maybe it was God's plan to guide me towards ACL, but I doubt he has to kill off my little brother to do that.<br /><br />So now I was wondering. If God has a plan, and we are all part of it, then why is it necessary to pray to God ? Why is it necessary to believe in him ? In fact, if God is so powerful, wouldn't he be able to bake this God-belief into people from birth, and make sure noone ever questions it ?<br />And if people start questioning it, maybe THAT is God's plan ? It could be argued that whatever you do in life, is actually a part of God's plan.<br /><br />I still don't believe in God, but I'm now more convinced that being nice pays off in the long run.<br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />The last time I prayed and believed it, was when I was 11.
