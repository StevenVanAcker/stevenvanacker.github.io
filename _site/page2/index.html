        VPS Comparison
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2011</span>

    In the past, I've used hosting provided by the university for a couple of my projects. With the closure of <a href="http://www.acl.be">ACL</a> however, that option is getting more difficult.<br /><br />In addition, The hosting solution used by <a href="http://www.overthewire.org">OverTheWire</a> is a dedicated server, on which we run our own virtualization platform. The resources on that server are getting exhausted.<br /><br />So I'm faced with a couple of solutions, the most realistic being to either get another dedicated server or get a bunch of virtual private servers. Since a dedicated server is too expensive to buy at once (I don't have 10 projects ligned up to fill a single dedicated server at once), I decided to go for VPS.<br /><br />There are a lot of VPS providers out there, and a lot of virtualization platforms. For the OverTheWire projects, I prefer Xen since that allows to run a custom kernel. For other projects, I don't really care that much, but it seems OpenVZ is a standard container-based solution.<br /><br />So, I set out to find the optimal hosting for my projects. I extracted the list of VPS providers that were listed on <a href="http://lowendbox.com">LowEndBox</a> and went over them one by one. Most VPS providers have more than one offer and I decided to look at the most common configuration to make it easier to compare.<br /><br />This is the list of requirements:<br /><ul><br /><li>as close to 512MB of dedicated (as opposed to burstable) RAM as possible</li><br /><li>Xen VPS is preferred over OpenVZ over any other platform</li><br /><li>Unmanaged is preferred, we like to do thing ourselves</li><br /><li>PayPal payment is preferred</li><br /><li>Should allow setting reverse DNS</li><br /><li>Should have some out-of-band console</li><br /></ul><br /><br />The list contains 287 entries of which 57 providers were down/out of business/no longer support VPS.<br /><br />I thought it would be an interesting excersise, with results that would be interesting to a lot of people. So I made it a community effort by putting up a google spreadsheet where people could help fill in the details.<br /><br />The result of the survey can be found here: <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AimYZRRoPGFidFhPTF9TdXRneVFxdkREeG5OcFhFZHc&authkey=CLDn6p8J&hl=en">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AimYZRRoPGFidFhPTF9TdXRneVFxdkREeG5OcFhFZHc&authkey=CLDn6p8J&hl=en</a><br /><br />Although a lot of fields are not filled in, like whether a VPS accepts PayPal, does rDNS or has a console (VPS providers should be more clear about this type of thing on their website), it is clear that there is a wide variety of solutions. Especially in price.<br /><br /><table border=1><br /><tr><th></th>                <th>Xen</th>    <th>OpenVZ</th>    <th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr><br /><tr><th>Amount</th>          <td>85</td>     <td>81</td>        <td>10</td><td>54</td></tr><br /><tr><th>Cheapest</th>        <td> 6 $</td>   <td>1.66 $</td>    <td>5.211 $(vServer)</td><td>5 $</td></tr><br /><tr><th>Most expensive</th>  <td>120 $</td>  <td>60.125 $</td>  <td>49.95 $ (HyperV)</td><td>63.46 $</td></tr><br /></table>

        ValueGuard: Protection of native applications against data-only buffer overflows
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2011</span>

    I graduated for the second time last year, getting me the grade of "Master in Engineering Science - Computer Science" and the title of engineer (ir.). My master thesis was in the area of computer security, specifically lowlevel security. The goal was to create a countermeasure to defend native applications (written in C) from data-only (or non-control-data) buffer overflows.<br /><br />The text of my master thesis can be found here: <a href="http://data.singularity.be/Trashcan/thesis2010/steven.van.acker-2010-06-16.hyperref.pdf">steven.van.acker-2010-06-16.hyperref.pdf</a>.<br />I also made a live-CD based on Ubuntu 10.04 that can be found here: <a href="http://data.singularity.be/Trashcan/thesis2010/livecd.iso">livecd.iso</a><br /><br />The reason I could not blog about this untill now, is because my promotor wanted to keep it quiet last year, and because the work also got published at <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/iciss10/">ICISS 2010</a>. The countermeasure was rewritten a bit, taking into account the lessons learned from the benchmarks in my thesis. The result is ValueGuard.<br /><br />Abstract:<br /><code><br />Code injection attacks that target the control-data of an application have been prevalent amongst exploit writers for over 20 years. Today however, these attacks are getting increasingly harder for attackers to successfully exploit due to numerous countermeasures that are deployed by modern operating systems. We believe that this fact will drive exploit writers away from classic control-data attacks and towards data-only attacks. In data-only attacks, the attacker changes key data structures that are used by the program’s logic and thus forces the control flow into existing parts of the program that would be otherwise unreachable, e.g. overflowing into a boolean variable that states whether the current user is an administrator or not and setting it to “true” thereby gaining access to the administrative functions of the program.<br />In this paper we present ValueGuard, a canary-based defense mechanism to protect applications against data-only buffer overflow attacks. ValueGuard inserts canary values in front of all variables and verifies their integrity whenever these variables are used. In this way, if a buffer overflow has occurred that changed the contents of a variable, ValueGuard will detect it since the variable’s canary will have also been changed. The countermeasure itself can be used either as a testing tool for applications before their final deployment or it can be applied selectively to legacy or high-risk parts of programs that we want to protect at run-time, without incurring extra time-penalties to the rest of the applications.<br /></code><br /><br />Link to the ValueGuard paper: <a href="http://data.singularity.be/Trashcan/thesis2010/valueguard.pdf">valueguard.pdf</a><br />Link to the same paper from Springer: <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/p26243813157387x/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/p26243813157387x/</a><br />Link to the LIRIAS database at the university: <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/289765">https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/289765</a>

    <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2011</span>

    For some reason, my resolutions for a new year mostly get implemented without any active work by me.<br />It's quite odd. Maybe I am aware of these objectives subconsiously ? Let's hope that this trend continues!<br /><br />My newyear's resolutions for 2011 (in no particular order):<br /><dl><br /><dt>Build the wargame for HES2011</dt><br /><dd>Apparently, the <a href="http://hes2010.labs.overthewire.org">HES2010 wargame</a> that I created last year was an overwhelming success. So much so that a lot of people have asked me to create the wargame for <a href="http://www.hackitoergosum.org">HES2011</a> too. I was already working on it of course, but it's still nice that people request it explicitely ;)<br /></dd><br /><dt>Eat less meat!</dt><br /><dd>At the Dranouter festival in August 2010, I saw an interesting presentation from a guy who said that if everyone would be a vegetarian half of the time, that would be the same as half the population being a vegetarian. Less animals get killed and noone has to stop eating meat completely. A very appealing thought! So, I will make an attempt at eating less meat. Maybe I can participate in the <a href="http://www.donderdagveggiedag.be">"Vegetarian Thursday"</a> initiative</dd><br /><dt>Visit Australia</dt><br /><dd>If I have enough vacation days that is... I would like to visit Australia and meet up with some friends there. Maybe I can go to Ruxcon 2011 :)</dd><br /><dt>Continue work on my CNC machine</dt><br /><dt>Do some decent work on my PhD</dt><br /><dt>Find a new house</dt><br /><dt>Release information on my master thesis from last year</dt><br /><dt>play more party games</dt><br /></dl>
