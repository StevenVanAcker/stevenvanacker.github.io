    I managed to put online all of my Pictures yesterday. They are current in the "sorted" album. All 2.8GB of them (about 3500 pictures). I had to upload them more or less manually since drupal wouldn't let me upload more than 200 at once. But I got it done. Another step closer to losing the old site.<br /><br />More scientific news today! Last tuesday I burned 617 KCal by cycling. Yesterday it was 861KCal by cycling 1 hour and rowing 20 minutes. I would have gone for 1MCal, but they kicked me out because of closing time ;)<br /><br />Since it takes 1 Cal (4.186 J) to heat 1 gram of water up by 1 degree Celsius (water in liquid form), I could have boiled 8.61 liters of water with what I burned yesterday. Not such a bad thing to think about, especially since I feel exhausted today.<br /><br />I've been working on nemo's challenge, and I know how to solve it, but not the exact procedure. It involves sending signals at the right time. I know that if a process is stopped, the signals are stored in a bitlist and processed when the process is continued.<br />However, not in the order I want...

        A brand new hammer

    <a href="http://www.ode.org">ODE</a> is an Open Dynamics Engine. You'd think that it would only do physics and the like, and you would be correct! However, when you install from source, you'll see that it comes with a couple of examples which all use an included drawstuff library. This library renders everything in <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> so you have something to drool at.<br /><br />At first I was thinking of using the drawstuff library for my car simulator (because everything is rendered automagically and uses shadows oooh :) ), but when I looked at the source I noticed its not really what I need. It has only the features required to draw stuff from ODE, and it comes with a bunch of mouse-button bindings (to change camera position, orientation, enable/disable textures, shadows, etc) that I don't like. To change them would require me to change the drawstuff library, and I wouldn't want to dig into that.<br /><br />So!<br /><br />I went on a google-expedition and I found <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre3D</a><br /><br />Ogre3D is an object oriented graphics engine. It has everything I would ever need: OpenGL and Direct3D support, its portable to Windows, it can load (or convert from) several 3D data formats, it has skeletal animation, reflection, refraction, transparancy, particle engines (for smoke etc), BSP, octrees, ...<br />And that's just what I can remember.<br /><br />In short, I think I might have found a new hammer to work on all my 3D graphics projects.<br /><br />I'm running <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> testing (or I was), and the Ogre libraries aren't in the apt repositories yet. They are in unstable though. So I upgraded everything to unstable ;)<br /><br />The samples were not included in the Debian repository (due to licensing issues???) so I was forced to compile from source...<br />...<br />It took me 7 hours to get it working!<br /><br />Luckily, the nice people from #ogre3d on irc.freenode.net were very helpful. I'm glad to see that Ogre3D has such good online support. It's not just the IRC channel, but also their entire site. They have a wiki with tutorials, a forum and they link to several projects building on Ogre3D.<br /><br />The creator of Ogre3D is even on the IRC channel! I spoke to him without realising who he was.<br /><br />Did I already mention I got my VISA card ? I put it to good use yesterday and bought 2 books on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568490151/103-3825030-3236639?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155">Parkinson's Law</a> by C.N. Parkinson and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568491611/103-3825030-3236639?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155">The Peter Principle</a> from Laurence J. Peter.<br /><br />I also made myself a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ref=cm_gft_sub_wl/103-3825030-3236639?%5Fencoding=UTF8">wishlist</a> and put all the Game Programming Gems books on it, so you people have a hint when it's my birthday ;)<br /><br />To avoid having to read all the amazon.com scams that I receive in my mailbox, I created a special mail-address, just for my account. This could be a handy tip for everyone wanting to register to Amazon or <a href="http://www.paypal.org">PayPal</a> or whatever.

        freshly squeezed orange juice
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Dec 2005</span>

    There's nothing like some freshly squeezed orange juice when you get up in the morning.<br />Whoever invented this should get a medal.<br /><br />So whats been going on ?<br /><br />I decided to buy a car to finally get my drivers license. A Peugeot 205 from 1995-1996, it costs 1000 euro. Then there's insurance (400 euro), roadtax (107 euro) and maintenance (37 euro). I still need to get license plates too. Taking the driving lessons again is going to cost a lot. In order to be able to drive around on my own, I need to follow 20 hours of lessons. Which is about 1000 euro all in itself. So this whole thing will cost me about 2500 euro. Finally something to save up for ;)<br /><br />To make sure I don't screw up again, I'm going to write a driving simulator which I will probably call Steven's driving school. It will use <a href='http://www.ode.org'>Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)</a>, <a href='http://www.openal.org'>Open Audio Library (OpenAL)</a>, <a href='http://www.opengl.org'>Open Graphics Library (OpenGL)</a> etc.<br />I've been studying <a href='http://home.planet.nl/~monstrous/tutcar.html'>the physics of cars</a> and have good hopes of being able to create a decent simulation. The first tests with ODE revealed that my graphics card (Intel915GM) sucks at 3D, or maybe I screwed up hardware acceleration if such a thing exists on this card.<br /><br />In any case, the simulator should allow me to drive around in a virtual world, without endangering other people. I can learn to do the maneuvers, replay what I did,look at it from different angles and develop "tricks" for people like me who don't have depth perception. (No thank you mister Driving School Instructor, I really can't see how far away the right side of my car is from the other cars, so shut up)<br /><br />I will obviously post all my advancements on here :)<br /><br />I can't wait to get a drivers license and a car to drive around the globe and do fun stuff. I'm already planning a couple roadtrips.<br /><br />In other news, the washing machine nixe brought with him from home is hooked up and working nicely as far as we can see. Now we only need something to dry the clothes ;) Since the air in the basement (where the machine is) is too cold to dry clothes in, we had to find something else... The bag of (what we thought was) charcoal we bought for our Annual 1st Of November BBQ was useful in lighting the odd heater we have in the basement. I'm not sure what the results will be, but I'm not worried (mostly since they're not _my_ clothes ;)<br /><br />I'm up early today and may well be doing so again for a longer time. I noticed my evenings are quite filled up in my current schedule. I did a short cycling session in the gym and burned 332 KCal (Level 5, Setting 9, 30 minutes). Maybe I'll write a drupal block to monitor my improvement.<br />It used to be a nice feeling when I was in topcondition, doing 1hour sessions every day for 2months.<br />I'm not sure why I ever stopped... Speaking of cycling, the steering axis on my real bike seems to have broken (God knows how this happened) and its not safe to drive around with it.<br />But since I have no other bike, and getting the bike fixed is not done fast I presume, I have to drive around on this on. Applying pressure to the right side seems to keep my wheel from turning in odd ways :)<br /><br />Time to get a haircut!<br />

        What a weekend
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Nov 2005</span>

    We had one hell of a busy weekend.<br /><br />It started last friday with the little party given by Nixe. He made Canard a l'Orange for the guests, but of course I was there to enjoy it too ;)<br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1000541|thumb=1|alt=234_large.jpg]<br /><br />As you can see in the pictures, it was a success. The mist you see hanging around in most of the pictures is because the oven was a bit too enthousiastic :)<br /><br />After the party, it started to snow(!).<br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1000565|thumb=1|alt=242_large.jpg]<br /><br />At first we thought it would melt away like it always does here in Belgium, but instead it kept snowing overnight and when I woke up the whole world was under a white blanket.<br />I had the most interesting bike-trip to the city that saturdaymorning. I almost fell on my face and some car thought I needed a shower. I any case, I got my new glasses! They cost around 680 euro and fit me really well said the store lady (I should think so, for 700 euro). At some point I should make before and after photos...<br /><br />The plan was to start painting the livingroom on saturdaymorning, but as I predicted, we didn't start 'till around 14h.<br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1000499|thumb=1|alt=220_large.jpg]<br /><br />We had removed all the crap (like a paper strip and nails) from the walls and filled the holes in the walls earlier that week. The painting was painful, but a success. Suffice it to say that after 3 layers of paint, we now had 1 white and 3 red walls combined with a very huge mess. At the beginning we were very careful to not drop paint on the floor. By the end we had already figured out that the paint could be easily removed with some water, and the floor was a real mess.<br />The furniture was all over the place and covered with a couple layers of plastic.<br /><br />Cleaning up was a lot more fun. We scrubbed the paint from the floors, and I electrocuted myself putting back the plastic covers on the power outlets in the wall. Now everything looks lovely :) (As you can see in the pictures)<br /><br />An unfortunate side-effect of the whole livingroom-repainting, is that the cablemodem is broken :(<br />I'll have to contact the ISP to see what is wrong with it. Untill they fix it, we're unplugged.<br /><br />Speaking of unplugging, I did some efforts to get more people on the <a href='http://www.pulltheplug.org/newfu/'>new Fun University</a> website. There are now 10 registered users and soon, the first 2 challenges will be posted.<br />

        Windows gives me stress
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Nov 2005</span>

    It's been some time since I blogged something. Mostly because I'm lazy...<br />Some things have happened: I ordered new glasses (which have arrived and I can go and pick them up) and I got myself a VISA card. In December, I'm going to <a href='http://www.ccc.de'>22c3</a> just like last year's 21c3. The plane tickets are booked, but the hotel isn't. They only take VISA... that's why I need it.<br /><br />So anyway, I get stress from Windows.<br />I'm watching Enterprise episodes on my laptop (doing a marathon like usual), when I come across an episode that won't open. It's not like the file format isn't recognized, nono, the codec crashes and spews a "Access Violation" at me.<br /><br />Being the debugger that I am, I type it into google and find that several other people have had the same error. Some people solved it by removing some file (which in my case doesn't exist), other people claim that they solved the problem by installing some obscure codec pack.<br /><br />[OK, so here's my first problem with this kind of situation: where the hell are the logs ? In any kind of decent system, you have tons of logs and debugging equipment to track down problems. Where can I find this in Windows ? The Event Viewer ? Oh please, don't get me started! It's like noone uses the Event Viewer, and when it gets used, its used to log obscure meaningless data.<br />How do people debug stuff in Windows ? Pure luck ? Is there some kind of logical track I can follow ? Some kind of feedback I can get ?]<br /><br /><br />On some french forum, I find a link to a codec for mpeg stuff (exactly what I seem to be in need of). I download it, unpack it and try to install it.<br /><br />[Shameless intermezzo continued! Isn't there some kind of central authority concerning video codecs ?? Why do I have to rely on data from webforums (In French!) (From strangers!) (Without any form of reputation!) to find out what software I need and where I can find it ? Why is there no software repository or some handy guide on how to 1) find out what codec I need to start with 2) find out if I already have it 3) in case I have it, is it causing the problem ? 4) I case I don't have it, where can I find it ?<br />Blah! Part of the problem would already be solved if there was some decent version tracking thing for codecs. For every codec, there are at least a dozen versions lying around, and you can't be sure that using a later version will provide everything an older version does. (Speaking of versions, have you noticed how software is getting more bloated and bloated with every new version, providing less useful functionality and more crap you don't need ? I don't need no DVD-burning functionality in my text-editor or a medialibrary in my music-player or a built-in browser in my instant messenger software! Thank you very much, but it's not because Microsoft allows you to easily integrate their crap into your crap, that you should do it! In fact, your software should do what I expect it to do and nothing else! But we're drifting...)]<br /><br />So I install it... And good god! I should have guessed it! The installer crashes! As it happens, the installer doesn't have a log either, or any decent information for that matter. It spews some crappy error message at me, and that's all she wrote.<br />Because this is Windows, and you never know what happens behind the scenes anyway, I cross my fingers and hope that that was the fix (It's a longshot, but then again, so is using Windows)<br />Yay! The error is gone! But wait! What is this ? Another error ? Yesyes<br />At first I thought: Oh well, 1 problem down, 1 problem more so in the end back where I started. But nono, the problem got worse!<br />Now I can't play ANY videofile. It always spews this same error message about a file I have never heard about.<br /><br />I do what I always do when things screw up in Windows: I reboot.<br />(I hope they never take away this basic Windows-fixing functionality! My, and most likely 99% of the other Windows users' debugging expertise involves rebooting Windows and see if the problem went away)<br />Nothing changed.<br /><br />So there I am, haven broken one of the most important rules in solving a problem: Never make it worse.<br /><br />Having had terrible bad luck following advice from webforums, I do the next best thing one can do in Windows: uninstall and install several applications and see if it makes a difference. I removed all software that had anything to do with video codecs and reinstalled it. Nothing good happens, I still can't play my favorite episodes.<br /><br />I found a codec pack that calls itself "All in one". Sounds promising no ?<br />I thought so too, so I tried to install it. The installer crashed (Who'd have guessed)<br /><br />[What is it with people writing installers that crash ? Don't they test their software ?]<br /><br />Images of me reinstalling Windows are flashing before my eyes. I even considered moving to Linux permanently on my laptop, like everywhere else where I want a work-environment I can trust, but then I remember that I'm lazy and I'd need to figure out some stuff like how to map the volume keys in linux to change the volume...<br /><br />This is realtime. I have just downloaded an ACE codec pack, which is 49MB big.<br />You'd think that for a file this big, it probably contains about every codec ever conceived. Knowing my luck in these situations, I probably wasted 50MB of my download volume and am going to make the problem worse.<br />Let's watch:<br /><br />Whadda ya know. The download says: error<br />So I really did waste 50MB.<br /><br />[Every other download site I try these days guides me through approx. 20 screens before I can actually download something. If you don't have to register, you have to endure mindnumbing ad-spam, look over a site with a lookingglass just to find a download button and then find yourself in a maze of "click here to continue" screens that make you end up in a place with "download mirrors". What is up with that ? I have to choose where I download this file ? Give me the data already! If you're lucky, you only need to go to about 3 mirrors to find a working one that goes fast enough so you don't have to wait 10 days before you can run the fine program. In my case, I had 2 mirrors, of which only 1 worked. And you can guess what happens, midway in the download, the download stops and I can't download any more. Then I have to type in the filename in google and download it in some other way. Great idea those download mirrors, if only someone would maintain it]<br /><br />5 minutes to go<br />I need a drink now<br />See what you make me do Windows ? Userfriendly, bah! You make me want to destroy something beautiful, but I won't. <br /><br />The installation detected that I have All-In-One installed and asks to remove it. I click yes and select "Yes to all" so that Windows doesn't keep bothering me all the time with stupid questions.<br /><br />[There's Yes, No, Yes to all, ... but where is No to all ? Design flaw ?]<br /><br />Now it detected I have DivX installed and wants to remove it. Naive as I am, I allow it to do so (otherwise I'll probably end up with a screwed Windows system with half the files missing)<br /><br />It detected that I have Nimo Codec Pack installed. Now I'm pretty sure I uninstalled that, but let the beast do its best and attempt to remove it anyway<br /><br />Ah now we're getting somewhere. I User Agreement of only 6(six) lines. This must be a first. Most agreement things are half a book long containing LOTS OF TEXT IN CAPS TO ANNOY THE USER (they can't annoy you be writing in fine print, so they have to find some other way)<br />Does anyone ever read these things ? I tried it once, its full of crap.<br />OF COURSE I ACCEPT<br /><br />After asking me alot (alot) of questions (probably to waste my time), it starts a DOS window (yes, it still exists) and runs an antivirus(?!)<br /><br />[How difficult is it to make a "Select all" option ? I mean, you've covered all other options like "lite", "minimalist", "player only" etc.]<br /><br />"The ACE Mega CoDeCs Pack is configuring your system" Thank you for that!<br />How about showing me what you're doing ?And drop the stupid CaMeLbAcK while you're at it.<br /><br />Just in case Windows decides to reboot now, I'll save this text and then press "Next"<br /><br />It didn't reboot!<br />And what's even better, I can play my episodes !<br />Yay for ACE CoDeCs Pack!<br /><br />Windows used to be OK when it was around it's Windows 98SE edition. Then they started adding stuff to give you "a better experience" and started adding layers of cruft to hide the "dirty" details of what happens behind the scenes from you and thats where they lost me.<br /><br />I'm a computer nerd. I know computers inside out, not just programs, but programming, protocols, concepts, hardware designs and software designs from the highest to the lowest levels.<br />But I can't grasp where all these things are hidden in the "better experience" of Windows these days. People have invented all kinds of words and nifty abbreviations to make computing sound difficult to the average user. Microsoft decided to annihilate that obvious superior advantage over the common man by inventing its own lexicon and abbreviations. This makes me feel stupid while I know I'm not. A note for Windows-lovers: Words are empty without meaning. Don't speak about things you don't know and don't claim that you understand things when you don't even know what it's about.<br /><br />All that being said, I believe <a href='http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/47221/index.html'>Windows is not ready for the desktop</a> anymore. My Windows installation is saved for another day. But I swear to god, one of these days I won't take the time to search google anymore...
