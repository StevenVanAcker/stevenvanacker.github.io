    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2007</span>

    I finished the test-oven a couple days ago, using a single halogen linear tube to heat the plastic.<br /><br />The test oven is a lot smaller than the real oven: 33 by 33cm. The plastic needed to be cut to size. Jim Egner (TK560) of http://www.tk560.com/ demonstrates how to cut plastic in one of his movies. Of course, it's not because he can do it that it works for me.<br /><br />The idea is to break the plastic in pieces and to use a cutting knife to cut grooves where the plastic should break.<br /><br />The first one was no problem, but the second time I broke the plastic this happened:<br />[G2:11875]<br /><br />Now I know I should be more careful.<br /><br />The second problem arose when I tried to clamp the plastic in the wooden frame. The wooden frame is too big and the clamps can barely get around it. So I decided to break out my new drill stand and drill a couple not-too-deep holes where the clamps fit in.<br />[G2:11882][G2:11885]<br /><br />Heating the plastic went pretty fast. The plastic was very close to the lamp and the plastic melted more rapidly in the middle than the outsides.<br />[G2:11888]<br /><br />I have nothing decent to use as a mold, so the mold I used is just some kind of ashtray that was lying around in the basement.<br /><br />The result: [G2:11891]<br /><br />I wasn't really happy with this result because the heat didn't spread out well enough to heat all the plastic.<br /><br />But hey, that's why it's a test right ?<br /><br />For the second attempt, I quickly cut some 10cm high spacers where the frame could rest on.<br />[G2:11894]<br /><br />For this test, I also reused the plastic from test 1. Because polystyrene is a thermoplast, that should be possible, and it was :)<br /><br />[G2:11897]<br /><br />Again, although the heat was spread out more evenly, I didn't like the result.<br /><br />I've decided to go with more lamps, and less power per lamp. The final oven will have 27 lamps of 150W each. Each 33x33 square (9 of those in the final oven) will have 3 lamps positioned in such a way that the heat spreads out nicely.<br /><br />[Update]<br />[G2:11905]<br />[/Update]<br /><br />I'm playing with the idea of attaching relays to every lamp so I can switch them on/off separately. When using a smaller sheet of plastic, there is no reason to turn on all the lamps anyway.<br /><br />Right now, the vacuform oven tests are on hold. My dad called me yesterday and said he has a couple meters of nichrome wire that I can use. If it's enough, I can surely do that.<br /><br />But, I'm more in favor of the halogen spots setup, because I can easily replace those linear tubes with new ones if they burn out. An extra advantage is that the linear tubes don't expose their wire to plain air, so there is no danger of electrocution. (Of course, for safety's sake, I should put big red flashing "HIGH VOLTAGE" signs around the oven)

    <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2007</span>

    The counter the problem of the burning wood, I bought a role of insulation material that is placed behind heaters to reflect heat and save energy.<br />[G2:11816]<br /><br />Cutting the material is NOT done like this (as I found out the hard way)<br />[G2:11832]<br />Because the styrofoam on that side will break in tiny pieces and the reflective side will rip.<br /><br />Instead, softly cut into the reflective side and break the styrofoam when everything is cut<br />[G2:11835]<br /><br />After everything was cut, the insulation fit perfectly<br />[G2:11841][G2:11844]<br /><br />And the insulation even works !<br />[G2:11847]<br /><br />The heat is definitely reflected better and no wood burns (except maybe those small pieces that are exposed between the cut material)<br /><br />Here's an interesting factoid though: the backside of the insulation material is made of styrofoam, which is expanded polystyrene. The very thing I want to melt with the oven ;)

    I've gotten sidetracked from the vacuform construction process. One late night I though it would be fun to see what the heat distribution of my vacuform oven would look like, if I used 9 halogen linear tubes as the heat source distributed evenly over 1 m^2.<br /><br />I went on to build a software simulator to generate some nice pictures of what it would look like. The first simulator was stochastic and the pictures were not really nice (see an older post). Version 2 of the simulator uses real physics to calculate the temperature change in each spot of the vacuform oven.<br /><br />This picture is the result of that simulator:<br />[G2:11745]<br /><br />The color indicates how hot a certain spot is. This is what the gradient looks like:<br />[G2:11748]<br /><br />An AVI file is available here (900KB):<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/vacuform/heat-distribution-non-stochastic.avi<br /><br />And an animated GIF here (2.3MB):<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/vacuform/heat-distribution-non-stochastic.gif<br /><br />Here are all the files and the code (9.5MB):<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/vacuform/heat-distribution-non-stochastic.tar.gz<br /><br />At this point I should probably say that I'm not a physicist or an engineer. So basically, I have no idea what I'm calculating when I do these simulations. They just seem to make sense as far as I know.<br /><br />In any case, this is where I got sidetracked. After spending hours (and hours) on the simulator, I still don't have any reasonable results because I have no idea if my simulator even matches the real world.<br /><br />So, let's just get on with it. Instead of using software to simulate the oven, I just built a smaller version of the oven. <br /><br />These are the professional blueprints<br />[G2:11760]<br />Apologies for not using the more standard cocktail napkin for this, but I had none handy.<br /><br />By the time I got to the basement, the plans had already been revised (just to show how rocksolid my ideas are)<br />[G2:11764]<br /><br />All the wood was cut to length (and recut to length after another design revision)<br />[G2:11767]<br /><br />And some holes were drilled with my newly bought drillstand. This drillstand is actually quite handy. When putting together the vacuform frame, all the holes I drilled were out of alignment. This thing makes sure that all holes are straight.<br />[G2:11770]<br /><br />Of course, it didn't take long to break the stand. What do you expect for 25 euro ? :) I'm taking it back to the shop to be replaced. The stand was still good enough to drill holes though.<br />[G2:11773]<br /><br />The mini-frame I built for this experiment is actually better constructed than it's bigger brother. Using pre-drilled holes, I was able to put the frame together very fast<br />[G2:11776][G2:11779][G2:11782][G2:11785]<br /><br />And here is everything together:<br />[G2:11788]<br /><br />Allright, now we are getting to the "Don't try this at home, kids" part. So, Don't try this at home kids:<br /><br />To mount the linear halogen tube into the oven, I made my own version of a lamp socket using a couple screws and bolts and some high-gauge electrical wire. At this moment, the oven will use only 500W (1 lamp), but when using 9 of them, it will suck 4500W. The wiring I use here is 4mm^2.<br /><br />[G2:11791][G2:11794][G2:11797][G2:11800][G2:11803][G2:11806]<br /><br />When plugged in, the oven lights up nicely<br />[G2:11809]<br /><br />But after only 10 seconds, the wood started to burn<br />[G2:11812]<br /><br />I expected this to happen (really) and bought some heat isolation that is placed behind heaters to reflect the heat. I will put it in there later and try again. Stay tuned

        melting polystyrene with halogen linear tubes ?

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2007</span>

    The normal approach to build the vacuform oven is to run a bunch of nichrome wire across some ceramic posts and hook it up to a powersource.<br /><br />But I don't have any idea where to get nichrome wire. I do however know that the efficiency of a halogen lamp is about 5%, which means that 95% of the power pumped into it is converted to heat.<br /><br />I tried heating up a piece of 5mm thick polystyrene using a 500W halogen lamp and was able to bend it after only a minute or 2. That's promising.<br /><br />Here's a picture of the bent plastic:<br />[G2:11637]<br /><br />Most circuits in this house are 230V at max 16A, which means about 3500W max (with some to spare...). I have 3 circuits with a 25A fuse especially for the cooking plates. Such a circuit would get me about 5500W.<br /><br />I'll be using a regular circuit for the vacuform, which means I can only put 7 500W halogen lamps in the vacuform. Another option would be to use 400W or 300W lamps, to have 8 or 11 lamps in there. I like the 11 lamps idea, because it's close to 9, which would make a nice 3x3 configuration.<br /><br />I've created a heat distribution simulator to calculate what the heat distribution of a linear tube would be on a flat surface. I wasn't trying to make it efficient, but I just wanted to practice some python ;)<br /><br />The program picks a random point on one of the configured linear tubes and then shoots a ray of light in a random direction. If the ray hits the flat surface (at a configured distance from the lamp), that spot is heated up. <br /><br />This technique is similar to stochastic raytracing, except that I have no idea if it's even accurate for anything :)<br /><br />The whole thing can be downloaded here:<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/heat-distribution.tar.gz<br /><br />An AVI movie can be found here (2.2MB)<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/heat-distribution.avi<br /><br />And an animated GIF is here (18MB)<br />http://www.singularity.be/Trashcan/heat-distribution.gif<br /><br />I will probably write a better simulator soon (I have lots of python to practice...)<br />
