    I packaged the versioning and backup scripts (and the icons) and created a private repository.<br /><br />http://www.singularity.be/ubuntu/<br /><br />I consider phase 2 finished, but I still have to document it.<br />Phase 1 (EncFS) should also be crafted into a package so I can install and maintain it easily. But this is not as easy as it sounds. When implementing phase 1 manually, I had to log out of my account and move files around quite often. That's not something that can be done in a package...

        How firefox became iceweasel: Mozilla's thickheaded lawyers

    Some time ago, Debian renamed it's firefox packages to "iceweasel", but I never looked into the why of this.<br />Now while I was trying to find information on using Evolution together with Karm, I ran into <a href="http://djst.org/blog/2006/10/12/replace-evolution-with-thunderbird-in-ubuntu/">this article</a> claiming that Ubuntu's users prefer Thunderbird over Evolution (the standard mailclient in Ubuntu) and that Ubuntu should switch to Thunderbird.<br /><br />Thunderbird is Mozilla's mail client by the way...<br /><br />A reader posted this comment:<br /><pre><br />Mario Says<br /><br />After all the copyright trouble Mozilla has caused with Firefox for Debian & Ubuntu, <br />I donâ€™t expect a single Mozilla application to make it into a default choice on this or any similar distro.<br /></pre><br /><br />This caused me to look into the copyright issue a bit further:<br /><br />http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3634591<br />http://enterprise.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/09/1434251&tid=41<br /><br />It seems Mozilla has a trademarked logo for firefox, and wants this logo included with all versions of firefox. Debian considers the logo to be non-free (because it's trademarked and thus not free for use) and didn't want to include it.<br />Mozilla didn't move an inch, so Debian renamed it's firefox packages to iceweasel.<br /><br />Does anyone else see a stupid dispute in this ? Isn't the opensource community about sharing code for free use ?<br />When did the lawyers take over ? <br /><br />I consider this a big screwup for Mozilla. I've never liked the firefox/thunderbird hype. Finally I have a reason to boycott them.

    I've looked at sbackup and I'm a bit disappointed :(<br /><br />It's true that it has a nice GUI and has many interesting features. But I can't get it to work nicely. First of all, I could not add my root directory (/) as a directory to be backed up. I had to edit the configuration file manually to get it in there. Then, for some reason, it started backing up my files locally instead of remote by making a giant tarball in /var/backup. That's not good :/<br />It's not like I forgot to set it to "remote backup". I even entered the correct information and setup an SSH-key. But sbackup "forgot" my settings and decided to stay local anyway.<br /><br />There's also a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sbackup/+bug/102577">bugreport</a> that claims sbackup is slow on a large collection of files (O(n^2)). The buglist makes it appear as if sbackup has been abandoned. And this feeling is only strengthened by the spam on the <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/RestoringFiles">SBackup wiki</a><br /><br />In light of all this, I decided to look away from sbackup and consider alternatives. Most of the backup solutions (if not all...) are concerned with backing up specific directories and archiving them.<br />In my case, I want a FULL system backup and I don't need an archive. A mirror is enough.<br /><br />So I'm going to drop the search and go with rsync. One of the problems I encountered during testing, is that I have to login as root on the remote host to preserve ownerships of files. There will have to be a large shift in my life before I allow something like root-ssh-keys stored on my laptop, just to do backups....<br /><br />Instead of pushing the backups, I will do a pull from my desktop computer. I can store a public SSH-key of my desktop machine on my laptop to allow automatic backups. If I don't want backups at some point, I can just remove the key. <br />Another advantage of using pull instead of push, is that I can backup at work AND at home, without modifying my laptop setup. Added bonus: if there's no network on my laptop, backups won't be started anyway because they are initiated from the remote site.<br /><br />I'll be working on a script to send me a notification when backup starts and when it ends. This script should be called by the remote host so that I'm notified that my laptop might be sluggish.<br /><br />[Update]<br />This is what I whipped up.<br /><br />On the remote site I have this script:<br /><pre><br />#!/bin/bash<br /><br />remotesite=192.168.1.49<br />localstore=/tmp/testbackup/<br />startstopscript="su guest -c \"/home/guest/bin/backup_startstop"<br />host=`hostname`<br /><br /><br /># notify the client that backup is about to start<br />starttime=`date +%s`<br />ssh root@$remotesite "$startstopscript start $host\""<br /><br /># do an rsync of the entire disk<br />rsync -e "ssh -l root" -ax $remotesite:/ $localstore &> /dev/null<br /><br /># notify the client that backup has ended and report runtime<br />stoptime=`date +%s`<br />delta=$(($stoptime - $starttime))<br />ssh root@$remotesite "$startstopscript stop $host $delta\""<br /></pre><br /><br />On the client computer (the laptop), I have this script:<br /><pre><br />#!/bin/bash<br /><br />cmd=$1<br />host=$2<br />delta=$3<br /><br /># the send_notification function sends a notification message to the dbus-daemon<br /># which pops up a message on the screen of the user.<br /># This script is sortof dirty because we locate an environment variable in /proc/<br /># somewhere, and the icon used is hardcoded.<br />send_notification()<br />{<br />    local title=$1<br />    local text=$2<br /><br />    for i in `pgrep -fu guest x-session-manager`;<br />    do<br />        x=`cat /proc/$i/environ 2> /dev/null| grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`<br />        if [ -n "$x" ];<br />        then<br />            export "$x"<br />        fi<br />    done<br /><br />    notify-send -i /home/guest/images/backup.gif "$title" "$text"<br />}<br /><br />function sec_to_read {<br />    s=$1<br />    d=0<br />    out=""<br /><br />    d=$(($s / 86400)); s=$(($s % 86400)); if [ $d -gt 0 ]; then out="$out$d day(s) ";    fi<br />    d=$(($s /  3600)); s=$(($s %  3600)); if [ $d -gt 0 ]; then out="$out$d hour(s) ";   fi<br />    d=$(($s /    60)); s=$(($s %    60)); if [ $d -gt 0 ]; then out="$out$d minute(s) "; fi<br />                                          if [ $s -gt 0 ]; then out="$out$s second(s)";  fi<br /><br />    echo $out;<br />}<br /><br /><br />case "$cmd" in<br />  start)<br />        send_notification "Autobackup started" "Automatic backup has started from $host"<br />        ;;<br />  stop)<br />        delta=$(sec_to_read $delta)<br />        send_notification "Autobackup ended" "Automatic backup from $host has ended.

        versioned backup reviewed: version 1.2

    I'm not happy with the versioned backup phase I have now. The versioned directories idea is a good one: I don't have to be too careful about changing files or even deleting them. The files are versioned so I can always revert to some previous version.<br /><br />What I'm not happy about is the way I plan to do backup. Why should I just backup the versioned directories and not the rest ? If it's on my laptop, it's probably important data so it should be backed up aswell.<br /><br />This brings me to the point that I want to backup my entire laptop. Or well, the partitions that I have Ubuntu on anyway.<br />I'm not sure yet about Windows, since that partition will not be mounted all the time...<br /><br />So the "versioned backup" phase should probably be split in 2: "versioned data" and "backup".<br /><br />The backup should be incremental and it should work over a flaky network since I don't plan to be online all the time.<br />My desktop machine on the other hand, will be on the wired network permanently. It will also have a central backup account on the Tivoli Storage we use at work. So, I just need to mirror my laptop to my desktop, and the data should be safe. <br /><br />Someone mentioned <a href='http://www.fluffy.co.uk/boxbackup/'>boxbackup</a> to me as a good way of making backups. Unfortunately, it does not have Ubuntu packages :(<br /><br /><a href='http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/HomePage'>sbackup</a> however, is supported by Ubuntu and comes with a GNOME GUI to configure it, and restore files.<br /><br />I've also looked at a way to keep track of projects I work on automatically. The favored candidate is <a href='http://gttr.sourceforge.net/'>GnoTime</a>, but it can't keep track of what I do automatically. It also looks like it can't be minimized to the taskbar. It looks like there is no alternative to <a href='http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ssk/kde/karm/karm.html'>Karm</a> and thus I will use it. I've thought about creating a GNOME karm clone myself, but that would get me sidetracked. The most important thing right now, is that I get my laptop up and running the way I want it.<br /><br />I will have to integrate the karm timesheets with my evolution calendar system, but that's not for now.
