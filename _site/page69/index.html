    It looks like some other people had the same as me, using RCS and vim together...<br /><br />There is a vim script <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=563">here</a> which you have to place in ~/.vim/plugin<br /><br />Also add this in ~/.vimrc<br /><pre><br />"re-map rcsvers.vim keys <br />map <F8> \rlog <br />map <F5> \older <br />map <F6> \newer<br /></pre>

    RCS is nice to keep a history of how files changes over time. "rcsdiff" then is a tool that can generate a diff-file between 2 versions of the same file.<br /><br />However, the diff is shown in standard "diff" output format. I prefer the "vimdiff" program (which comes with vim in Debian).<br /><br />The vimdiff command takes 2 files and shows them side by side in vim, using syntax coloring and such. But vimdiff can't work with RCS...<br /><br />So I created this script which I'll call rcsvimdiff. It combines both functionalities in one.<br /><br /><pre><br />#!/bin/bash <br /><br />ver1=$1<br />ver2=$2<br />file=$3<br /><br /><br />if [ "x$file" = "x" ];<br />then<br />        echo "Usage: rcsvimdiff -rREV1 -rREV2 filename"<br />        exit 0<br />fi<br /><br />if [ ! -f $file ];<br />then<br />       echo "File $file doesn't exist."<br />       exit 1<br />fi<br /><br />if [ ! -f $file,v -a ! -f `dirname $file`/RCS/`basename $file`,v ];<br />then<br />       echo "File $file has no RCS history"<br />       exit 1<br />fi<br /><br />basefile=`basename $file`<br /><br />TMPDIR=/tmp/rcsvimdiff.$RANDOM$RANDOM$RANDOM<br /><br />for v in $ver1 $ver2;<br />do<br />    mkdir -p $TMPDIR$v || exit 1<br /><br />    cp -f $file $TMPDIR$v/<br />    cp -f `dirname $file`/RCS/`basename $file`,v $TMPDIR$v/<br />    cp -f $file,v $TMPDIR$v/<br /><br />    co -f $v $TMPDIR$v/$basefile<br />done<br /><br />vimdiff $TMPDIR$ver1/$basefile $TMPDIR$ver2/$basefile<br /><br />for v in $ver1 $ver2;<br />do<br />    rm -rf $TMPDIR$v<br />done<br /></pre><br /><br />Usage: rcsvimdiff <-rREV1> <-rREV2> <filename><br /><br />For example: rcsvimdiff -r1.1 -r1.3 /etc/motd

    I'm an idealist.<br />I believe in the ideal society. One where everyone can be happy and everyone is equal.<br />Such a society would undoubtebly be a democracy: a society governed by itself, with noone better than the next. A democracy with freedom of speech: a prerequisite for a democracy. Unlimited freedom of speech that is, because everything should be open for discussion and argumentation.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that I had to realize how far away we are from such Utopia.<br /><br />Some newspaper did a poll.<br />To the question "Do you think it should be possible to ban certain books ?", 54% of this country's population answered "Yes"<br /><br />Why does this scare me ?<br />I don't want to live under censorship. I enjoy my free speech. But apparently, 54% of my fellow citizens believe otherwise. This leads me to conclude that we don't deserve democracy because we are too stupid to handle free speech.<br /><br />But I digress from the topic.<br /><br />Some time ago, I was planning to do some work for a good cause. But I had some doubts towards my motives. I came to the following conclusion:<br /><br /><pre><br />It is better to do the right thing for the wrong reasons,<br />then to do nothing at all.<br /></pre><br /><br />When I think back, I've done a lot of things to help others with the hope that they would like me.<br />Most of the time though, these people were not so grateful (if they cared at all)<br />I consider it a flaw in me. It's easy to take abuse of my good intentions. And maybe this is the source of my distrust against all people.<br /><br />A friend once said:<br /><pre><br />Gratitude is one of the worst reasons to help people for.<br /></pre><br /><br />And I can only agree with him. I should stop doing things for people in the hope that they will thank me or be nice to me.<br /><br />But I still like to do good.<br />I still plan to work on good causes.<br /><br />And giving blood last week, is one of those causes.<br /><br />Twice every year, 2 studentgroups organise a blooddrive called <a href='http://www.landbouwkring.be/bloedserieus/'><br />BloedSerieus</a><br />This year I participated, because I believe my blood can do some good to some poor sucker in a hospital somewhere.<br />The good thing about giving blood, is that it is it's own reward. I don't expect anyone to be grateful for my blood.<br /><br />I plan on giving blood on a regular basis now...<br /><br />Since I noticed that <a href='http://www.bloedserieus.be'>http://www.bloedserieus.be</a><br />had not been registered yet, I took the liberty to do so.<br />At first, I pointed the URL to the original BloedSerieus website. But since the blooddrive is over and the site didn't contain information on where to go to give blood if someone still wanted to, I made a small text and pointed the URL to that.<br /><br />Now all it needs is a couple links and google will index it :)<br />

        A day in hell

    Today was a winner in the TOP-10 of suckiest days in my life.<br /><br />The goal was to compile a 2.6.16 kernel with all the needed drivers, including those for vmware. I've spent the ENTIRE day doing 20 or 30 compiles, without success. In the end, I just gave up.<br /><br />On top of that, the changes I made in the webserver configuration of the Ekonomika server were acting up. Normally a redirect directive should apply to the virtualhost it is defined in. Not anymore it seems.<br />For some reason, the normal redirect from ekonomika.be to www.ekonomika.be was overridden and pointed to mailman.ekonomika.be.<br />I couldn't find anything that could explain this behavior, except that redirects are now globally effective (which is denied by the documentation).<br />So what is it ? A bug in apache ? Is my config wrong ? bah! It worked before, why should it suddenly fail ?<br /><br />To make things worse, I was involved in solving a problem with drivers in Windows XP... over MSN... involving someone who knows nothing of computers...<br />I spent an hour trying to figure out what was happening on the other screen, to the point where I was about to lose it.<br /><br />Windows blows.<br /><br />I'm gonna make a T-shirt that reads: Take your lousy Windows problem and shove it up your ass.<br /><br />Or something more fitting, in case small children are around.<br /><br />To ease my mind, I'm trying to solve the problem with the kerneldrivers in vmware. I found <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:ZzrPt1by8vsJ:https://bear.eecs.umich.edu/trac/wiki/LinuxKernel+vmware+kernel+config+2.6+buslogic+&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=8&client=opera">this reference</a> which states<br /><pre><br />It appears that VMware's default SCSI driver also has problems. In the VMware<br />setup, choose to use the BusLogic SCSI driver instead of the default. That<br />seemed to help the boot process get futher later on.<br />...<br />Create a VM in VMware for the Fedora Core 4 installation. I used the BusLogic<br />SCSI driver. To do this, when setting up the VM initially, choose "Custom"<br />instead of "Typical". Later on in the setup process, choose BusLogic instead<br />of the default SCSI driver.<br />...<br />If you have problems when booting, you may want to capture the system boot<br />messages. You can do this by redirecting them to a fake serial port, and having<br />VMware capture the fake serial port to a file. See http://www.coolverification.com/2005/12/debugging_fc4_k.html for details.<br /></pre>

    It's been 1 year since my first post. The only thing that changed, is that I don't seem to bring up the effort to post blog-entries :)<br /><br />Some updates from the past couple days... <br /><br />I put an IDE controller in a PCI slot of my new machine at home (called Dikke Berta or Berta short, since it has 1.25TB of storage and that's even fatter than bigboy which only had 560GB)<br />and was able to boot ubuntu and install it. Some problems occured though. From time to time I would find my machine totally dead. With nothing in the logs, I (apparently rightfully so) suspected a hardware problem. My harddisks were not cooled and were running at between 50 and 60 degrees C.<br /><br />After adding 2 coolers, the temperature dropped by 20 degrees. I haven't had a crash since...<br /><br />In the area of stepper motor controller, I've put together an L297 and L298N chip and hooked it up to a PC PSU and my K8000. It works nicely, and I only need data signal coming from my computer (the clock signal) instead of the 4 I used without microchips.<br /><br />I have some pictures, although not online yet.<br /><br />I really should get working on a good way to post images on drupal...
