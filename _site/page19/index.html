        An evolution plugin for Symantec Enterprise Vault

    <!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />Dilbert is one of my favorite comics, but I never realised how close it came to the truth.<br /><br />But I can't talk about that any further, because we've been strongly influenced to tell everyone how great the entire Microsoft Exchange groupware project is.<br /><br />Frequent readers of this blog will without a doubt know that I'm an advocate of free software and open standards. That's one of the reasons I'm paying close attention to non-Microsoft usage of this groupware project.<br /><br />We will use an excellent mail archiving solution from Symantec called "Enterprise Vault" (E-vault) which is more or less like a "sophisticated" cronjob pulling old mails from the Exchange server and archives them in a database somewhere else. The archived mail is then replaced by a mailstub on the Exchange server so that users can use that mailstub to retrieve their archived mail from E-vault.<br />This solution from Symantec is much better than the solution we have now (which does the same thing). because it's more expensive and works together with a proprietary closed-protocol, closed-source system.<br /><br />E-vault can be queried in 2 ways. It has a website that users can login to and search for their archived mails, and it has a plugin for Microsoft Outlook that has the same functionality but baked into the Outlook interface.<br /><br />Everyone else at our university will have to go through the webinterface.<br /><br />Jealous of the Outlook users, I decided to take a look at how the E-vault plugin retrieves the mails from the E-vault server. It does that by retrieving a DVS file (Digital Vault Saveset) which is a <a href="https://forums.symantec.com/syment/board/message?board.id=106&message.id=834">compressed version of the archived mail with some metadata</a> but of which the specification is a secret and no tools exist in the wild to analyze them.<br />This of course raises the question what we will ever do if we decide to migrate away from E-vault, but then I'm sure that Symantec will help us to convert our DVS files to a mailformat of our chosing, because they are such nice guys.<br /><br />Obviously, the DVS files are of no use for me because I can't read them, but I've found a way to retrieve the uncompressed version of the DVS file and parse it. This type of file is refered to as the MSG format and is actually a <a href="http://sc.openoffice.org/compdocfileformat.pdf">Microsoft Compound document</a> containing a pre-parsed version of the original mail.<br />I wrote a parser for this format using Python and it works. Next, I will look into how I can make an Evolution plugin that can retrieve such MSG file and render it in Evolution.<br /><br /><br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />Dilbert is one of my favorite comics, but I never realised how close it came to the truth.<br /><br />But I can't talk about that any further, because we've been strongly influenced to tell everyone how great the entire Microsoft Exchange groupware project is.<br /><br />Frequent readers of this blog will without a doubt know that I'm an advocate of free software and open standards.
