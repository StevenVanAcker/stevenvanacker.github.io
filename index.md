<div class="frontpicture"></div>

My research interests are topics in computer and software security, specifically web security,
and performing large-scale experiments on the Web/Internet.

Outside of academia, I am involved in the OverTheWire wargame network, which I have
managed, developed and maintained as the primary staff member since 2005.

I enjoy playing CTF games, created the Hacknam Style CTF team at KU Leuven in 2012,
and was the team captain until I left in March 2015.

Aside from software, I am also interested in robotics and I enjoy tinkering with
electronics and robots. I am fascinated by industrial-scale machinery and automation.

Away from the computer, I run several races per year, most recently the midnattsloppet (10km)
races in Stockholm, Helsinki and Gothenburg, and the GÃ¶teborgsvarvet (21km).
