<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />Ah, it's been a while since I've posted anything in English...<br /><br />2 Days ago, my TV broke down. I have no idea what caused it (and I haven't even looked whether or not the fuse blew out), but I don't really care.<br /><br />This is what the current situation looks like:<br />[FULLIMG:http://data.singularity.be/images/full/undated/mediawiring-old.png]<br /><br />I have a satellite decoder which outputs an analog signal on a SCART cable to my (now broken) TV.<br />I also have a PS3 connected to a projector using HDMI, and a PC with a DVI output on its graphics card connected to the projector with a DVI to HDMI convertor cable.<br /><br />This setup has a couple of annoying side-effects: I can't watch TV on the projector because it doesn't have an HDMI output. I also can't play PS3 on a screen in broad daylight, because my TV can't process HDMI input.<br /><br />A possible new solution is this one:<br />[FULLIMG:http://data.singularity.be/images/full/undated/mediawiring-new.png]<br /><br />If I can buy a satellite decoder which outputs HDMI, I could connect it to a HDMI switch together with the PS3 and the PC. If I can then get a HDMI-capable monitor (that supports HDCP for the PS3), I could hook it up as an output to the HDMI switch together with the projector.<br /><br />What will this setup cost me ? I will need the following:<br /><br /><dl><br /><dt>digital satellite decoder</dt><br /><dd><a href="http://www.tv-vlaanderen.be/pid_TVVontvangerHDTVexclSC.asp">Philips HD DSR 7121/7122 of TV-Vlaanderen</a>, 300 euro</dd><br /><dt>HDMI capable monitor</dt><br /><dd><a href="http://www.komplett.be/k/ki.aspx?sku=437377">Acer 24" Wide H243H</a>, selected because of low power consumption, 255 euro</dd><br /><dt>HDMI switch 3->2</dt><br /><dd><a href="http://www.apogeeinc.net/products/item.aspx?item=2761">HDMI 4x2 True Matrix Switcher v1.3 w/ 35m Signal Repeater Equalized Chipset</a>, 100 euro(?)</dd><br /><dt>3 more HDMI cables</dt><br /><dd>100 euro(?)</dd><br /></dl><br /><br />Total: 755 euro.<br /><br />Maybe a bit steep, we'll see...<br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />Ah, it's been a while since I've posted anything in English...<br /><br />2 Days ago, my TV broke down.
