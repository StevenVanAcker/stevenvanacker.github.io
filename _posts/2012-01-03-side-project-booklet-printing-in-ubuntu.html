For example, you could create an A5 booklet by printing a document on A4 paper, 2 sheets per page, with the sheets arranged in such a way that the resulting pages of A4 paper can be folded in half to form an A5 booklet. <br /><br />I prefer booklet printing of documents over plain duplex printing because it wastes a lot less paper, and results in a more comfortable size to carry around said printed documents. <br /><br />Unfortunately, Ubuntu doesn't have a booklet printing option unlike MacOSX (so I've been told). This means that printing documents as booklets involves saving the document and running it through a couple of commandline tools before sending it to the printer. Because these steps are too elaborate, I knew my natural laziness would kick in and I'd stop printing booklets if there was no automated solution. <br /><br />I decided to create a CUPS backend to print booklets. Once installed, the booklet printer that uses this backend is available to any program that uses CUPS for printing. On Ubuntu, that means every program :) When the booklet backend receives the PDF document, it converts it into booklet form and forwards it to any printer you want. <br /><br />The backend script requires a couple tools that need to be installed first: <pre><br />apt-get install impose+ psutils<br /></pre> The <a href="http://data.singularity.be/booklet/booklet">code for the backend</a> then, is very simple:  <br /><pre>#!/bin/bash<br /><br />if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then<br />    echo "direct booklet \"Unknown\" \"Print a document in booklet form\""<br />    exit 0<br />fi  <br /><br />out=${DEVICE_URI#booklet:/}<br />user=$2<br />title=$3<br /><br />cat $6 | fixtd -tumble | psbook | /usr/bin/pstops "2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)" | lpr -T "$title" -U "$user" -P "$out"<br /><br />exit 0<br /></pre><br /><br />To use this backend on Ubuntu, download the code into <b>/usr/lib/cups/backend/booklet</b> and set it executable. Then, goto <a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631</a> and login to your CUPS interface. Create a new printer of the booklet type. Next, type in the booklet printer URI:  <b>booklet:/MyPrinter</b> (mind the single slash) will install a booklet printer that forwards the processed document to the "MyPrinter" printer. Make sure it's a duplex printer. Give the printer a name (e.g. "booklet") and indicate that it is a Generic Postscript Printer. Finally, set some default options. In my case, I want A4 paper and duplex along the long edge (standard). <br /><br />The printer should now be installed and ready for use <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nRjUsfj92KA/TwR7zGwm9kI/AAAAAAAAAM0/tznGOj0DJDI/s1600/Screenshot-15.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="275" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nRjUsfj92KA/TwR7zGwm9kI/AAAAAAAAAM0/tznGOj0DJDI/s320/Screenshot-15.png" width="320" /></a></div></div>
