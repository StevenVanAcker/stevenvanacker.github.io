Things are not going well in the projects department.<br /><br />As has happened before, my life has filled up with all kinds of urgent crap that I need to take care of first. Being ill at the moment, doesn't help. So all of my projects are temporarily suspended for a couple of days or maybe weeks.<br /><br />In the meantime, I hope to resolve a lot of this daily-life crap so it's off my mind when the time comes to work on my projects again.
