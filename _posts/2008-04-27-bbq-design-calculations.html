<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />Some quick numbers from the hardware store:<br /><br />They sell aluminum square tubing, 25 by 25mm across with a 2mm wall, at 5.05 Euro per meter.<br />Such tubing weighs <a href="http://www.allmeasures.com/Formulae/static/materials/2/density.htm">496.8g per meter</a>.<br /><br />I need 6x40cm and 6x80cm for the support structure, which is 7.20m in total, 36.36 Euro, weighs 3.577 kg.<br />I need 2 sheets of 80cm x 40cm x 2mm, 2 of 80cm x 10 cm x 2mm and 2 of 40cm x 10cm x 2mm. That's a total of 1760 cubic centimeters, weighing 4.752kg.<br /><br />In total, the BBQ will weigh more or less 8.5kg.<br /><br />I'm also considering using aluminum for the grills, since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum">it resists corrosion remarkably well</a>.<br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />Some quick numbers from the hardware store:<br /><br />They sell aluminum square tubing, 25 by 25mm across with a 2mm wall, at 5.05 Euro per meter.<br />Such tubing weighs <a href="http://www.allmeasures.com/Formulae/static/materials/2/density.htm">496.8g per meter</a>.<br /><br />I need 6x40cm and 6x80cm for the support structure, which is 7.20m in total, 36.36 Euro, weighs 3.577 kg.<br />I need 2 sheets of 80cm x 40cm x 2mm, 2 of 80cm x 10 cm x 2mm and 2 of 40cm x 10cm x 2mm.
