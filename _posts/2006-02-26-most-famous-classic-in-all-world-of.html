While I'm on this blog, I should record some stupid things.<br /><br />I should check if mythtv has the ability to keep a database of timings with each media-file so I can skip commercials or intro/outro generics for each of them. I'm thinking about for example That 70's show, which starts with some content, then a generic, then the rest of the content, then a closing generic and then sometimes some content at the end. I'd love to have a meta-database with timings so I can skip the boring parts.<br /><br />Next, I tested my infrared led in Windows XP with my GSM and it worked ok. That gives me hope that its not broken, despite what tests showed in linux.<br /><br />Last but not least, I dug up my old wireless headphones and they still work ! This means I can listen to music all the time without bothering anyone :) They have a 80m range, so I could go to the store across the street while listening to my music :P that would be awesome<br />
