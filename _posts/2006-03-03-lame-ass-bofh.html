I was surfing around and decided to take a look at the new <a href='http://www.theregister.co.uk/odds/bofh/'>BOFH episodes</a>. After reading the last 3 or so, I came to the conclusion that Simon Travaglia (author of BOFH episodes) has lost his edge. BOFH these days is totally lame. It reminds me of the tough talk I sometimes hear when hanging out with other nerds. "Oh noes, I typed rm -rf / when I should actually have type ps" *geeky laughter follows* and then a part of me dies because I know why it should be funny to geeks but actually isn't.<br /><br />BOFH is getting just like that. He used to get around just fine without having to resort to words. His superiority eradiated from the story. But I guess these days are over and I need to face the fact that I'm getting old, remembering the good old days...<br /><br />I should start rereading the old BOFH episodes again. Without the stupid Boss and PFY, where users trembled in fear when they met the BOFH.<br /><br />*I pick up the phone*<br />&lt;me&gt; Yes?<br />&lt;BOFH&gt; Hi, I'm the new version of the BOFH<br />&lt;me&gt; What's your username ?<br />*He tells me*<br />*clickety*<br /><br />&lt;/irony&gt;
