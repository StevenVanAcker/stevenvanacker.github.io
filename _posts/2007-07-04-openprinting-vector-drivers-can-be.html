It appears that the OPVP (OpenPrinting Vector Printer device in ghostscript) is already implemented, even in ubuntu edgy!<br /><br />The drivers used by the OPVP device are actually dynamically loaded libraries implementing this API:<br />ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/fsg/vector/pdapi-spec-1.0rc1.pdf<br /><br />I would be fun to try to implement this and hook it up to my simulator.
