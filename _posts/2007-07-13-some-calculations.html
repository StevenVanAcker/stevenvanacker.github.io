After doing a lot of reading on the subject, I finally started doing some calculations regarding sizes. It's not much, but it's a start.<br /><br />Because I'm lazy and I don't want to drill a zillion holes in the platen, I will go with a single-hole design. This also happens to be the best way to work with differently sized plastic sheets.<br /><br />The polystyrene sheets sold at the hardware store are 100cmx200cm. The 100cmx100cm sheets are cheaper, so I will be buying those. This means my machine needs to be able to work with 100cmx100cm sheets MAX.<br /><br />One of the applications I want to use vacuforming for, is to create a cover for my lawnmower robot. I estimate it will be pretty big (because I'm an amateur ;)<br /><br />So, I will design my vacuform machine to have a 100cmx100cm platen.<br /><br />Because of this size, I'll also create an over/under model. This means that all the components are aligned vertically. The oven on top, the platen right below it. Total surface area for this machine will be 1m^2, which is OK for me.<br /><br />So, I'm basically  building a giant closet with 3 levels: 1 for the oven, 1 for the platen, and 1 below the platen where I can place my vacuum cleaner or vacuum pump and tank. I won't consider the oven at this point, because it needs to be constructed from a heat-resistant material and I don't have a clue about that yet. <br /><br />The local hardwarestore sells MDF panels of 244cmx122cm big (both 12 and 18mm thick).<br />This is how to plan to cut them up: 2 big panels of 102cmx102cm, and 8 102cmx10cm pieces. I'll have a 20cmx40cm piece leftover (in white).<br />[G2:11432]<br /><br />I'll get 4 metal L-profiles of 2m long to use as corners. The 8 MDF pieces will fit between those metal profiles, making 2 squares: 1 for the platen, 1 for the shelf below. The bigger 102cmx102cm pieces will rest on top of those squares (just like shelves).<br /><br />The reason that all pieces are 102cm long and not 100cm, is because I want some room to maneuver with the holding frame for the plastic. 1cm on each side should be enough room to maneuver.<br /><br />Hopefully, I will get all this stuff from the hardware store and start putting it together tomorrow.<br /><br />Also, I've been wondering if my vacuum cleaner is powerful enough to pull plastic with this thing. On the TK560 forums, the power of a vacuumcleaner is measured with inches of mercury. Now my vacuum cleaner doesn't mention anything like that in it's manual ;)<br /><br />Here is an online convertor between pressure units:<br />http://www.vacuum-guide.com/english/equipment/calculatorpressure.htm<br /><br />I haven't checked if my vacuumcleaner is powerful enough yet...
