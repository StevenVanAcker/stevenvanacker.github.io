Creating private Debian packages in a repository has a lot of advantages. But when this repository gets large enough (and contains very old<br /><br />I maintain a repository of selfcreated Debian and Ubuntu packages. The packages I create get tweaked alot during testing, so that several versions of each package exists in the repository. After some time, these obsolete packages slow down dpkg-scanpackages alot and I've often wished to clean them up.<br /><br />After looking around a bit, I though <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/admin/apt-move">apt-move</a> would provide a solution. But this tool (like many other) seems to assume that I only have a cache repository in /var/apt/cache or where-ever. This is not the case.<br /><br />So I looked at the source of the problem: <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/dpkg-dev">dpkg-scanpackages</a>. This tool detects the old versions (when reporting them) and is written in perl.<br /><br />So I created this patch for /usr/bin/dpkg-scanpackages:<br /><br /><pre><br />--- /usr/bin/dpkg-scanpackages 2005-05-26 19:42:35.000000000 +0200<br />+++ /tmp/dpkg-scanpackages 2007-04-13 10:45:59.211260520 +0200<br />@@ -109,15 +109,17 @@<br /> <br />     if (defined($p1{$p})) {<br />  if (&vercmp($tv{'Version'}, $pv{$p,'Version'})) {<br />+     if ($ENV{"DEBDELETE"} and -e $pfilename{$p}) { $str=" [DELETED]"; system "mv $pfilename{$p} /tmp/"; } else { $str=""; }<br />      print(STDERR " !
