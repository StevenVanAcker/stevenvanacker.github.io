I don't know if it was reported to Microsoft, but I will try to do so now<br /><br />[Update]<br /><br />The <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/contactbug/">official way to report bugs to Microsoft</a> is by phone. Since I can't make international phonecalls from my desk here, that will not be an option.<br /><br />After a search on the (slow) Microsoft supportsite, I found a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942180/en-us">knowledge base article</a> called "You cannot access Outlook Web Access that is published by ISA Server 2006 from a mobile device that runs the Symbian operating system".<br />If Microsoft knows about this bug, why isn't it fixed yet ?
