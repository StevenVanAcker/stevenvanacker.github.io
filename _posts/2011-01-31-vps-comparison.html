In the past, I've used hosting provided by the university for a couple of my projects. With the closure of <a href="http://www.acl.be">ACL</a> however, that option is getting more difficult.<br /><br />In addition, The hosting solution used by <a href="http://www.overthewire.org">OverTheWire</a> is a dedicated server, on which we run our own virtualization platform. The resources on that server are getting exhausted.<br /><br />So I'm faced with a couple of solutions, the most realistic being to either get another dedicated server or get a bunch of virtual private servers. Since a dedicated server is too expensive to buy at once (I don't have 10 projects ligned up to fill a single dedicated server at once), I decided to go for VPS.<br /><br />There are a lot of VPS providers out there, and a lot of virtualization platforms. For the OverTheWire projects, I prefer Xen since that allows to run a custom kernel. For other projects, I don't really care that much, but it seems OpenVZ is a standard container-based solution.<br /><br />So, I set out to find the optimal hosting for my projects. I extracted the list of VPS providers that were listed on <a href="http://lowendbox.com">LowEndBox</a> and went over them one by one. Most VPS providers have more than one offer and I decided to look at the most common configuration to make it easier to compare.<br /><br />This is the list of requirements:<br /><ul><br /><li>as close to 512MB of dedicated (as opposed to burstable) RAM as possible</li><br /><li>Xen VPS is preferred over OpenVZ over any other platform</li><br /><li>Unmanaged is preferred, we like to do thing ourselves</li><br /><li>PayPal payment is preferred</li><br /><li>Should allow setting reverse DNS</li><br /><li>Should have some out-of-band console</li><br /></ul><br /><br />The list contains 287 entries of which 57 providers were down/out of business/no longer support VPS.<br /><br />I thought it would be an interesting excersise, with results that would be interesting to a lot of people. So I made it a community effort by putting up a google spreadsheet where people could help fill in the details.<br /><br />The result of the survey can be found here: <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AimYZRRoPGFidFhPTF9TdXRneVFxdkREeG5OcFhFZHc&authkey=CLDn6p8J&hl=en">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AimYZRRoPGFidFhPTF9TdXRneVFxdkREeG5OcFhFZHc&authkey=CLDn6p8J&hl=en</a><br /><br />Although a lot of fields are not filled in, like whether a VPS accepts PayPal, does rDNS or has a console (VPS providers should be more clear about this type of thing on their website), it is clear that there is a wide variety of solutions. Especially in price.<br /><br /><table border=1><br /><tr><th></th>                <th>Xen</th>    <th>OpenVZ</th>    <th>Other</th><th>Unknown</th></tr><br /><tr><th>Amount</th>          <td>85</td>     <td>81</td>        <td>10</td><td>54</td></tr><br /><tr><th>Cheapest</th>        <td> 6 $</td>   <td>1.66 $</td>    <td>5.211 $(vServer)</td><td>5 $</td></tr><br /><tr><th>Most expensive</th>  <td>120 $</td>  <td>60.125 $</td>  <td>49.95 $ (HyperV)</td><td>63.46 $</td></tr><br /></table>
