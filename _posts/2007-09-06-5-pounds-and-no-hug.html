Linux Conference is not all about techie stuff. Once the talks are over, it's time to eat and go home.<br /><br />So, tuesday evening we were looking for dinner at a store (Sainsbury Central or so) when suddenly the alarm goes off. I saw some people running away from the store and it was clear that they robbed something.<br /><br />So when we got outside, the robber was already caught by the police, not even 10 meters outside of the door. The guy had stolen 4 bottles of expensive champagne, probably not to drink them. 2 police officers were on top of him holding him down.<br /><br />Anyway, life goes on right ? So we walked down the street to go to the Subway sandwich bar a bit further. Around the corner come 2 patrol cars and a police van at high speed (probably around 90 or 100km/h) driving towards the other 2 policemen.<br /><br />This is all new to me. First of all, I have never seen policemen in action inn Belgium. And it's not like we have no crime or anything. Maybe this was a lucky strike and maybe Belgian police also reacts this fast. But still... the police caught this robber redhanded and only 10 meters outside of the store, with a huge display of police-force.<br /><br />It got me thinking about how poverty exists in other countries aswell (obviously)...<br /><br />When we got out of the Subway sandwich bar, a guy and a girl came to me and asked if they could have some money for food. They looked like they could use it. So I grabbed my wallet, and gave them all the change I had in my wallet.<br />Which, for some reason, was quite a lot. I believe it was 5 or 6 pounds. They were very happy. The girl said she would hug me, but "he's my boyfriend".<br /><br />So, no hugs for me :(
