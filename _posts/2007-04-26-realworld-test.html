2 days ago, I installed Ubuntu Feisty to see if my hardware would bring me any new problems. It seems not.<br />(My laptop is a Dell Latitude D610 with ATI X300 graphics card).<br /><br />I did however have problems getting wireless to work. For some reason, my ancient wireless setup using WEP, wouldn't allow my laptop to connect. But now that I've "upgraded" my accesspoint to WPA, problems are gone.<br /><br />I'm glad to report that "Suspend" works nicely out of the box, and closing the lid will put the laptop in suspend. Exactly what I want.<br /><br />Just to be on the safe side, I will reinstall ubuntu again and see how much I need to tweak to get things done.<br />This time, I'll also create a swap partition to try out Hibernate.
