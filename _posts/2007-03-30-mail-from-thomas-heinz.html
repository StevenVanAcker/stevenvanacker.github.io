I received a mail from Thomas Heinz today, one of the authors of NF-HiPAC. It seems that I wanted to replace the "..." in <a href='/node/6304'>one of my previous posts</a> with his name at some point, but forgot that somehow. Anyway, it's nice to see that I'm reaching some people with my website ;)<br /><br />In addition, Thomas also provided me a link to their <a href='http://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/papers/H-HiPAC-04.pdf'>master thesis</a>, which I couldn't find at first. I'll be reading it soon.
