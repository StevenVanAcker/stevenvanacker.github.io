I'm sitting in our newly designed livingroom today.<br />Nixe was cleaning up yesterday when he suggested that it might be better if we moved the diningroom furniture and livingroom furniture around and we did.<br />It certainly looks more efficient this way. I'll upload a picture when I take one (and when I manage to get an easy interface to do so)<br /><br />I've been looking at the img_assist code to see if I can fit in code to support acidfree albums. It looks easy enough, and I might be experimenting with it later today.<br />Things I still need to make uploading pictures not a pain in the ass: <br />- Windows XP Publish to web facility<br />- an easy way to add images from acidfree into any node (i.e. img_assist, but modified to use acidfree backend)<br />- a faster way to rotate images once they have been uploaded<br />- an easier way to create an acidfree album<br /><br />Maybe I can make a perlscript that will automagically create an acidfree album and upload an entire batch of pictures into it. Something like the galleryadd.pl script from <a href='http://lsb.blogdns.net/software/image_pub'>image_pub</a>, but for use with acidfree.<br /><br />In other news, I think I will by myself a <a href='http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?key=HW-SPAR3-CPLD-DK'>Spartan 3 High Volume Starter Kit Bundle</a> from Xilinx to fiddle with FPGAs a bit<br /><br />For today, I plan to go through the rest of this 1800-page NetScreen manual (of which I've read 670 pages so far) and hope my eyes don't burn out by reading all that "we have our own terminology" blabber...<br />
