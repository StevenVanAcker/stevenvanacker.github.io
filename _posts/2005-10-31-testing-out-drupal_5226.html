I've decided to look at Drupal for my new website. It's not that I'm tired of coding PHP and looking for interesting CSS constructs, but I believe the Drupal people do a better job at it.<br />I've found that installing the software is really easy and works out of the box.<br />The configuration and tuning is something that will require more work. I'm still reading the documentation (Why isn't there a PDF version of this ? Then I could print it for easier reading)<br /><br />I'm excited about all the contributed Drupal modules and I'm planning to deploy Drupal in a lot more places if this experiment turns out to be a success.
