The cleaningcrew was so nice to powerdown my desktop computer at work today. I understand that they need to clean my desk from time to time (even when I do it often enough myself) and I can even live with the fact that they throw all my stuff on a pile when they clean. But powering down my computer ? Damn you !<br /><br />Well, it's been a couple of months since I last rebooted my desktop computer, with a "couple" being in the 2-digit range (hey, it's linux! Rebooting is an invention of Microsoft)<br /><br />So it was no surprise that my desktop machine didn't come back the way it should have... For some reason, the bootup sequence just froze when trying to start Apache2.<br /><br />Instead of debugging the problem, I just ignored it and went on with my business of moving boxes around. (Moving our entire lab to the other side of the building, quite an intense job)<br />I decided to boot an Ubuntu CD and make a backup of all my important files. It took all day... While it was backing up, I used my laptop as workstation and was quite happy to do so. It's nice how things just work in Ubuntu.<br /><br />So, instead of trying to get my desktop back in working order, I will probably move ahead of schedule and just install Ubuntu over it. The desktop machine will serve as a base-station for my laptop (to do backups and that kind of stuff), but I see no reason to run Debian on it anymore.
