Allright, it's been a while since I've actively worked on my new laptop installation.<br />Now that my laundry is done, my laptop is backed up and I reinstalled ubuntu with a working(!) CD-R, I'm ready to document how I can connect to my GSM from my laptop using bluetooth.<br /><br />Remember, I want to do the following things:<br /><ul><br /><li>send files from my GSM to my laptop</li><br /><li>send files from my laptop to my GSM</li><br /><li>send SMS messages with my laptop, using my GSM<li><br /><li>receive SMS messages the same way</li><br /><li>use my GSM as a modem to do dialup networking, the regular way and GPRS</li><br /></ul><br /><br />[Reminder: I need to set the default colors of the gnome terminal to white-on-black, or install the multi-gnome-terminal instead]<br /><br />I'm starting by installing both gnome-phone-manager and bluez-gnome, since they worked nicely before.<br /><br />Now, in order to get gnome-phone-manager to work, I need to set up the /dev/rfcomm0 device. In my previous setup, I had to edit a configfile manually for that. (/etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf)<br /><br />Before I do that, let's see if I can find my GSM phone. I've set it to be visible to others over bluetooth and inititated a scan with "hcitool scan".<br />And whaddayaknow, it show up!<br /><br />Because this is a walkthrough, I'll show off a few commands to play around with. <br /><br />The "sdptool" command can be used to browse all services on a bluetooth device, or search for a specific service on all bluetooth devices in range (very handy).<br />It will show, for example, which devices support dialup networking, OBEX file transfers or serialport functionality. My GSM has all those things :)<br /><br />I started "bluetooth-applet" manually into background, because I'd have to restart X in order for it to start otherwise (why is that anyway ?)<br />Next, I've edited /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf and uncommented to rfcomm0 section, inserted my GSM's "mac-address" and description.<br />I also executed "/etc/init.d/bluetooth restart" to let the changes take effect.<br /><br />I had expected to see a /dev/rfcomm0 device appear, but it doesn't...<br /><br />I forgot to set "bind" to "yes" in /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf, and restart /etc/init.b/bluetooth.<br />Now there is a /dev/rfcomm0 device.<br /><br />I also installed gnome-bluetooth to be able to send files from my laptop to GSM using bluetooth, from the gnome menus. "Send to" in the right-click dropdown menu now has an "Bluetooth (OBEX push)" option.<br /><br />To receive files from my GSM on my laptop, I installed "obexpushd". It needs to be started in the directory that I want the files to be written to. It works nicely, but I'd prefer a GUI version somehow...<br /><br />It gets even better. There is a package called "gnome-vfs-obexftp" which can "mount" a bluetooth device like my GSM and show it in nautilus.<br />Now I can just drag and drop from/to my GSM like any other folder.<br /><br />Allright, I think I've experimented enough so far.<br />I can now send and receive files to and from my GSM. Time to fixate this blurby documentation into <a href="/node/6384">a decent guide</a> before I move on to the SMS sending/receiving.<br /><br />Writing this guide will require me to reinstall Ubuntu (so I can test my documentation on a fresh installation, my standard documentating procedure), so I will be doing dished in the meantime (Yes, I'm merely human aswell ;)
