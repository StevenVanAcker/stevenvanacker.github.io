My vacuum cleaner is a <a href="http://www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/catalog/product.jsp?language=nl&country=BE&catalogType=CONSUMER&productId=FC8602_01_BE_CONSUMER">Philips Expression FC8602</a> capable of sucking air at a rate of 40l/s and pulling a vacuum of 30kPa.<br /><br />According to <a href="http://www.vacuum-guide.com/english/equipment/calculatorpressure.htm">the pressure unit convertor</a> I found earlier, that's about 9 inches of mercury. Hopefully, that will be enough.<br /><br />I've also seen "CFM" mentioned a lot. CFM stands for Cubic Feet per Minute, with 1CFM being about 0.472l/s. So my vacuumcleaner would be able to pull about 84.7CFM
