My quest for a decent plastic-producing technique has not been successful so far, and damnit, I've tried! (Just <a href='/search/node/plastic'>search for "plastic" on this blog</a>)<br /><br />During my research, I came across the vacuforming process. A sheet of plastic is heated untill it becomes elastic, and then it's stretched over a mold. The air between the mold and the plastic is sucked away and the plastic fits on the mold like a glove. This is the exact procedure that is used to package all kinds of products (especially toys). A couple video's about this process can be found here: http://www.imperial-armor.com/videos.html<br /><br />Since the process of vacuforming is so simple (it doesn't even involve weird chemical formulas or strangely-named, unhealthy-vapor-releasing solvents), it should be no problem to build a vacuform machine at home.<br /><br />Jim Egner from http://www.imperial-armor.com linked above, is a StarWars fan who hosts an older site http://www.tk560.com (After his StarWars designation) and who has built a vacuform machine.<br /><br />My goal is to create one of those machines aswell. It will be one of the projects for the summer of 2007.<br /><br />[Update 23.00]<br />I went down to the hardwarestore to write down some prices for things like PS, MDF, several types of wood and aluminum sheets. Here's the list (all prices in euro):<br /><br /><table><br /><tr><td>PS transparent 100cmx200cmx2mm</td><td>29.04</td></tr><br /><tr><td>PS transparent 100cmx200cmx5mm</td><td>67.67</td></tr><br /><tr><td>PS white 100cmx200cmx2.5mm</td><td>35.42</td></tr><br /><tr><td>PS transparent 100cmx100cmx2mm</td><td>11.34</td></tr><br /><tr><td>PS white 100cmx100cmx2.5mm</td><td>15.33</td></tr><br /><tr><td>MDF 244cmx122cmx12mm</td><td>23.31</td></tr><br /><tr><td>MDF 122cmx61cmx12mm</td><td>10.55</td></tr><br /><tr><td>MDF 122cmx61cmx18mm</td><td>13.75</td></tr><br /><tr><td>OSB wood 122cmx61cmx11mm</td><td>8.21</td></tr><br /><tr><td>OSB wood 122cmx61cmx18mm</td><td>13.95</td></tr><br /><tr><td>AGGLO wood 250cmx125cmx18mm</td><td>15.67</td></tr><br /><tr><td>AGGLO wood 125cmx62cmx12mm</td><td>4.91</td></tr><br /><tr><td>AGGLO wood 125cmx62cmx18mm</td><td>6.89</td></tr><br /><tr><td>wood 240cmx5mmx20mm</td><td>2.98</td></tr><br /><tr><td>wood 240cmx5mmx10mm</td><td>1.30</td></tr><br /><tr><td>aluminum sheet 50cmx50cmx0.5mm</td><td>12.59</td></tr><br /><tr><td>metal perforated L profile 200cmx27mmx27mm</td><td>11.59</td></tr><br /></table><br /><br />I've been reading a lot about making a vacuform machine on the tk560 forum. While I wait for the registration process to finish so I can ask some questions on the forum, let me lay them out here first.<br /><br />The first part of the vacuform machine is the forming surface. So far, I've seen only 1 approach: 2 MDF panels with a small "sandwich" in between (a couple mm), then a metal sheet on the top and perforated through the metal and the first panel. Also, a hole in the bottom panel for the vacuum cleaner.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.tk560.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=497'>This thread</a> hints about a better way to create this forming table. Instead of a sandwich and a bunch of small holes, only a single hole is used. This should allow for a better seal (not sure why at this point). BUt more importantly, I believe this design can make it possible to use different sized plastic sheets to vacuform. That would be really interesting, since I don't want to use a huge sheet every time I vacuform something small.<br /><br />So what would a vacuform look like that allowed different sized sheets ?<br /><br />Another question on my mind is: what is the metal sheet for on top of the forming surface ?<br /><br />And: how is the vacuum tank supposed to work ? Pump all the air out of it with a vacuum pump, attach it to the vacuform and open the valve ? This could save me from having to buy a powerful vacuumcleaner...<br /><br />[Update]<br />some pictures of polystyrene sheets and their prices<br />[G2:11436]
