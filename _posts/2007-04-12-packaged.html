I packaged the versioning and backup scripts (and the icons) and created a private repository.<br /><br />http://www.singularity.be/ubuntu/<br /><br />I consider phase 2 finished, but I still have to document it.<br />Phase 1 (EncFS) should also be crafted into a package so I can install and maintain it easily. But this is not as easy as it sounds. When implementing phase 1 manually, I had to log out of my account and move files around quite often. That's not something that can be done in a package...
