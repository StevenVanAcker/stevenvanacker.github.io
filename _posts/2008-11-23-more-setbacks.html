<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />Some time ago I bought a MAX232 chip to convert RS232 levels from my serial port to TTL 5V levels. I also bought a DB9 connector and some capacitors to go with it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can no longer find those. I've pretty much looked everywhere.<br /><br />This is a bad setback for me at the moment. Everything seems to be going wrong lately and its brought my morale down to a very low level. If I don't do something interesting or fun soon, I'm going to get lost, crash down and burn alive. I've been there once, it's horrible.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if this is what psychopaths go through before they snap. Not that I see myself becoming one, even under the worst of conditions.<br /><br />I need to either focus hard on what I'm doing and forget the rest of the world, but that's what I've been trying to do and it's not working.<br />The other option is to go out and do social activities, have fun and relax. I have no idea how to do that.<br /><br />ObMovieQuote:<br />[PRE]<br />Nash: What do people do?<br />Alicia: . . . It's called life, John.
