I finally found out how to get sound out of my port replicator when my Latitude D610 is docked.<br /><br />Go to the volume control (speaker icon next to the clock applet) and right click it. Then under File -&gt; Change Device, select "Intel ICH6 (Alsa Mixer)". Then go to the Switches tab and turn "IEC958" on<br /><br />There! :) Now I just need to automute when my screen is locked. If I don't, my colleague switches off my speakers...<br />
