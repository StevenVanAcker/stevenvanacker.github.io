I'm trying to find out how I can prevent a .BAT batch script from exiting when it encounters an error. Looking on google gives me a number of hits, with useful information apparently on www.experts-exchange.com. However, the useful information is blanked out with the following message:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />All comments and solutions are available to Premium Service Members only. <br /><br />Start your 7 day free trial and see for yourself why Experts Exchange is the easiest and most proven technology resource in the world.
