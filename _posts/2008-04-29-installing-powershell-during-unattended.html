<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />For the past couple days I have been working on fully automating a Windows Server 2003 installation, complete with all software I want on it. The idea is that when the automated installation completes, I can sysprep the system and clone it to create N ISA servers quite fast, to play with.<br /><br />More information on this installation process later.<br /><br />What I want to post right now are the difficulties I'm running into when installing the .NET framework from within the installation process of Windows. I'm running a script from the "[SetupParams]" section in the WINNT.SIF answer file.<br /><br />The script tries to install "dotnetfx3.exe" (.NET 3.0 framework) but fails for some reason. So now I'm following <a href="http://monadblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/installing-powershell-with-unattended.html">some instructions</a> that specify how to install "dotnetfx.exe" (.NET 2.0 framework) instead.<br /><br />I get the following error: "Error 25007. Error occurred while initializing fusion. Setup could not load fusion with LoadLibraryShim(). Error: The handle is invalid."<br /><br />[FULLIMG:http://data.singularity.be/images/full/2008-04-29-unattended-windows-server-2003/dotnetfx.exe.FAIL.png]<br /><br />A workaround:<br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/06/591694.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/06/591694.aspx</a><br /><br />But that one doesn't seem applicable to me. maybe I should try to install dotnetfx3.exe again, but this time when the user logs in for the first time and making sure that administrator is logged in automagically at first boot.<br /><br />Bah!<br /><br /><br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />For the past couple days I have been working on fully automating a Windows Server 2003 installation, complete with all software I want on it.
