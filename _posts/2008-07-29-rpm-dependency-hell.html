<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />Now that I've automated the installation of mediawiki on Fedora 9 using puppet, I thought I'd see if I could install the OpenID extension for mediawiki and maybe automate that installation as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mediawiki-openid extension requires php-openid (OpenID implementation in PHP) which is not to be found in the standard Fedora repositories. However, I have found it in the <a href="http://atrpms.net/dist/f9/">ATrpms Fedora 9 repository</a>. After adding that one in my yum config it showed that it also contained a mediawiki-openid package. Things were looking up!<br /><br />However, this is the error I get when trying to install said package:<br /><br />[PRE]<br />[root@localhost ~]# yum install mediawiki-openid.noarch <br />atrpms                                                   |  951 B     00:00    <br />fedora                                                   | 2.4 kB     00:00    <br />updates                                                  | 2.3 kB     00:00    <br />Setting up Install Process<br />Parsing package install arguments<br />Resolving Dependencies<br />--&gt; Running transaction check<br />---&gt; Package mediawiki-openid.noarch 0:0.8.2-7 set to be updated<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-pear-Auth-OpenID >= 2.0.1 for package: mediawiki-openid<br />--&gt; Running transaction check<br />---&gt; Package php-pear-Auth-OpenID.noarch 0:2.0.1-4.fc8_93 set to be updated<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-pear-DB >= 1.80 for package: php-pear-Auth-OpenID<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-pear for package: php-pear-Auth-OpenID<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-pear-Net-Curl for package: php-pear-Auth-OpenID<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-bcmath for package: php-pear-Auth-OpenID<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-pear(PEAR) for package: php-pear-Auth-OpenID<br />--&gt; Running transaction check<br />---&gt; Package php-pear-Auth-OpenID.noarch 0:2.0.1-4.fc8_93 set to be updated<br />--&gt; Processing Dependency: php-pear-DB >= 1.80 for package: php-pear-Auth-OpenID<br />---&gt; Package php-pear.noarch 1:1.7.1-2.fc9 set to be updated<br />---&gt; Package php-bcmath.i386 0:5.2.6-2.fc9 set to be updated<br />---&gt; Package php-pear-Net-Curl.noarch 0:1.2.5-1.fc9 set to be updated<br />--&gt; Finished Dependency Resolution<br />php-pear-Auth-OpenID-2.0.1-4.fc8_93.noarch from atrpms has depsolving problems<br />  --&gt; Missing Dependency: php-pear-DB &gt;= 1.80 is needed by package php-pear-Auth-OpenID-2.0.1-4.fc8_93.noarch (atrpms)<br />Error: Missing Dependency: php-pear-DB &gt;= 1.80 is needed by package php-pear-Auth-OpenID-2.0.1-4.fc8_93.noarch (atrpms)<br />[root@localhost ~]# <br />[/PRE]<br /><br />That's right: broken dependencies.
