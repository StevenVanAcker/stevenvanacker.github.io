Here are some links that have been in a tab in my browser for quite some time, trying to remind me that I should write them down somewhere:<br /><br /><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms811813.aspx">ISA Server Administration Object Model (Graphical)</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a href="http://powershell.com/">Powershell plus (Powershell editor)</a><br /><br />I've looked at this powershell editor, but I'm not really impressed. YMMV
