[G2:11476]<br /><br />I assembled the frame for the vacuform machine today. After half an hour measuring, and another half hour drilling, I was ready to assemble everything. As I expected, I was unable to drill the holes straight down, most of them are 5-10 degrees off :(<br />I need to get a column-drill thingy...<br /><br />Also expected: the side-pieces (on which the 102cm squared panels rest) don't fit together nicely in the corners. That's why I bought the planer, and I still need to use it on those side-pieces.
