<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />The internship I was mentoring has ended. My intern did an excellent job working on the <a href="http://palantir.kulnet.kuleuven.be/">Palantir project</a>. Before I announce the project to the main public, I would like to have some eyecandy so people will actually notice the announcement. That's why I'm playing around with povray and trying to make a goodlooking palantir scene.<br /><br />This is what I have so far: (1.8MB, 4000x3000 pixels, fits nicely on my twin-screen desktop)<br /><br />[IMG:2008-06-06-povray/palantiri.png]<br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />The internship I was mentoring has ended.
