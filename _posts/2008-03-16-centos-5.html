Next to Fedora 8, I plan to try out Centos 5 because it is supposed to be more secure and stable (why else would Redhat use it over Fedora ?)<br /><br />It appears I can reuse the kickstart file I created for Fedora 8, since the installation went ok.<br /><br />But then come the problems.<br /><br />Under Debian, after a basic install, I can use this sequence of commands to install any package thats known in the Debian universe:<br /><br /><pre><br />. /etc/bash_completion<br />apt-get install &lt;some package&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />I include bash_completion here because it is a vital tool for me on any modern Linux system (because I'm a bad typer, I rely on bash completion a lot. And it's also a lot faster to work with)<br /><br />Under CentOS, there is no bash_completion and there is no apt-get. Instead, there is yum.<br />So first thing to try: <br /><pre><br />yum install bash-completion<br /></pre><br /><br />FAIL! bash completion is not a standard package in CentOS. So what do I need to do to get bash_completion in CentOS ?<br /><br />First, I need to magically be aware that this package is availabnle in a thirdparty repository called "RPMForge" (http://wiki.centos.org/Repositories)<br />Next, I need to configure RPMForge on my CentOS installation:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Install the priorities package with yum:<br /><br /><pre><br />yum install yum-priorities<br /></pre><br /></li><br /><li><br /><li>check /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/priorities.conf to see that its configured correctly (it was)</li><br /><li>Edit all *.repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ and add a "priority=N" line in every config section where N differs depending on the section you're in<br /><br /><blockquote><br />[base], [addons], [updates], [extras] ... priority=1 <br />[centosplus],[contrib] ... priority=2<br />Third Party Repos such as rpmforge ... priority=N  (where N is > 10 and based on your preference)<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I really like that last line, where I can choose N based on "my preference". I took 13 since I have no idea how I should decide what my preference is <br /></li><br /><li>Next, I need to wget an RPM here and install it<br /><pre><br />wget http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/i386/RPMS.dag/rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm<br />rpm -Uvh rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm<br /></pre><br /></li><br /><li>yum check-update to check that it worked (! remember, this is supposed to be a stable system)</li><br /><li>And finally, install some package<br /><br /><pre><br />yum install &lt;some package&gt;<br /></pre><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><br />But wait, it's not over yet!<br /><br />So now I have installed bash-completion using yum<br /><pre><br />yum install bash-completion<br /></pre><br />And it pulled it from RPMForge yay!<br /><br />So, what did all this get me ?<br /><br />Under CentOS, I can install 6537 (over 4000!) packages. I'm impressed.<br />Under Debian stable, I can install 19939 packages.<br /><br />I checked the versions of bash and SSH under both CentOS 5 and Debian stable (currently Etch). They are the same: bash 3.1.17 and OpenSSH 4.3<br /><br /><br />I hope kickstart is able to configure everything for me and install bash-completion by default.<br />We'll see...
