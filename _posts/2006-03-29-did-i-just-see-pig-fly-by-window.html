I was reading the news this morning when I noticed that a parliamentary commission had formed a majority on the Picanol law... with Vlaams Belang.<br /><br />I couldn't believe it. It really read that VLD and MR had formed a majority on the Picanol law which would force companies to publish the salaries of the topmanagers.<br /><br />Of course it all blew up in the afternoon. VLD announced that it wanted to change the law that was agreed on, so Vlaams Belang pulled out.
