According to <a href='http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/WritingAndPackagingPrinterDrivers'>this site</a>, I need to use the OpenPrinting Vector API to make a plotter driver that can be used by GhostScript.<br /><br />The <a href='http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/spec-raster.html'>CUPS raster driver</a> renders postscript to a raster image, which is not what I want. I want pen-strokes! :)<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the openprinting vector people are anywhere close to a useable software yet. So I might have to do some weird stuff...<br /><br />The people in #ghostscript on freenode advised me to extend the IJS driver. But that doesn't look right to me. According to <a href='http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs'>this page</a>, the data fed to the IJS driver is a bitmap (so a rastered image).<br /><br />I wonder how other plotters do their stuff...
