As if noone had seen it coming, the USA has turned into a flat-out fascist regime, a dictatorship waiting to happen.<br /><br />http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/february2006/010206detentioncamps.htm<br /><br />While the US army is bullying middle-eastern countries for their oil, and taking away the freedom of people where-ever they set foot, their fatherland is being crushed by pre-emptive measures to counter terrorist attacks and their people are giving up the last of their freedom out of fear. For some reason this reminds me of a hamster gnawing off its own limbs when stuck between the bars of it's cage.<br /><br />All of the time when gun-nuts in the USA were clinging to their weaponry, crying "from my cold dead hands", preaching that the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution'>second amendement</a> was necessary to be able to overthrow the government went the need would arise, they were right ! Maybe we have come to the point where they have to take up their weapons and overthrow the regime so they can save their precious freedom.<br /><br />Although, most of the gunnuts reside in Texas, which is also where most of Bush's support comes from. Thats would be a very sad thing...<br />Then again, there may not be any brave men left in the USA...
