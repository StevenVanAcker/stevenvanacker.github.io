After yesterday's adventure with taking pictures of my lungs (which prove btw that I did indeed have some kind of lung infection, still visible on the photo's), it was too early to pick up my medication.<br /><br />So I stopped by UPC to finally get that new internet connection I promised myself a long time ago. They will hook me up this tuesday.<br /><br />The new internet connection pushed me to look into the whole fileserver thing again. So I looked up my old notes and compared them to the new prices. The only thing that changed is the processor price. (In fact, the one I had in mind is no longer sold and I'd have to go with an athlon 64 3500+, not a big problem for me)<br /><br />When I got to the computerstore and explained what I wanted, the owner shifted into a 30-minute lecture about the new Intel Core Duo CPU's and how wonderful they are and whatnot. He also showed me a motherboard they had been testing: <a href="http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ClassValue=Motherboard&ProductID=2295&ProductName=GA-965P-DQ6">Gigabyte 6-Quad</a>. I told him I'd look into it, mainly because I didn't want to just buy old crap after such a long time of stalling the purchase.<br /><br />I looked at the <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/07/14/core2_duo_knocks_out_athlon_64/">CPU benchmarks</a> and they are absolutely stunning. The new Core Duo's blow the Athlon 64 out of the sky on every terrain: better performance, much lower power consumption and less heat dissipation.<br /><br />So my mind was already half set to get this new godly piece of silicon (65nm technology vs 90nm btw). <br />My attention shifted to the proposed motherboard. It has 8 (eight) SATA2 connectors, which made me "yippie", onboard sound, enough PCI and PCI-e slots and a very good power supply towards the CPU.<br />I convinced myself that the extra 200 euro would be well spent and that the new fileserver would outperform anything I had in mind before. But then I remembered I want to run linux on it...<br /><br />The motherboard has a <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/products1-2.aspx?modelid=2006072">Realtek ALC888DD chipset</a> which has me worried a bit. Although there is a <a href="ftp://202.65.194.18/pc/hda/alc888/ALC888_DataSheet_1.0.pdf">datasheet</a> for it, which would allow a linux driver, I can't get the <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/products1-2.aspx?modelid=10">Realtek RTL8139 chipset</a> out of my mind which, although cheap, is of terrible design (I had a link to a kerneldriver with comments depicting just how awful this chipset is, but I can't find it... maybe it's <a href="http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~fanf2/hermes/src/grub-e1000/netboot/rtl8139.c">this one</a>)<br /><br />Then I thought about the intel P965 chipset. I actually haven't heard of anyone who was able to run Linux on it. This could be because it's so new of course. The motherboard has 2 SATA controllers: one is the ICH8R chipset (the southbridge) and the other is some Gigabyte thing I never heard of. The ICH8 will probably work in Linux, but I don't know about the Gigabyte SATA2 controller...<br /><br />So before I buy this thing I'll ask the shopkeep if he tried running Linux on it.<br />I've also looked at the alternatives... They have 1: The <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=744">MSI P965 Neo</a> motherboard. It only has 5 SATA2 connectors though, not enough.<br /><br />While looking up this motherboard, I saw another one based on the P965: <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=745">MSI P965 Platinum</a>, which has 7 SATA connectors. The audio chipset is again a realtek one... :(
