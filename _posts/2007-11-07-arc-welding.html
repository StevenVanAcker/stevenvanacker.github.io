This year I enrolled in an arc welding course. If you've read this site often enough, you will probably not be surprised why I'm doing this :)<br />The course started september 4th with classes every tuesday from 18.30 till 22.00.<br /><br />Here are some pictures of workpieces I brought home:<br />[G2:12452]<br /><br />Booth 7, 2.5mm Lastek electrode 008 (fast): surface at 80A, outer corner at 72A, inner corner at 88A (when welding flat)<br />Booth 7, 2.5mm Lastek electrode 001 (slow): outer corner at 75A, inner corner at 95A (when welding at 45degrees)<br /><br />the inner corner needs to be welded VERY closely, to avoid slag inclosure
