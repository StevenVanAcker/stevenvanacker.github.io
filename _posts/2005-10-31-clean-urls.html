Clean URL's seem to be working, also out of the box.<br />Following the documentation on <a href='http://drupal.org/node/15365'>http://drupal.org/node/15365</a>, I only had to enable "Clean URLs" in the settings section of the administer interface.<br />Everything else was already set! I'm pretty sure this is Debian's doing :)
