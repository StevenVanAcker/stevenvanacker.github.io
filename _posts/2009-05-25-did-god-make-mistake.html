<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />I ponder about some of the more important aspects of life while I study for my exams, like this for example:<br />[FULLIMG:http://data.singularity.be/images/full/undated/why_do_adam_and_eve_have_belly_buttons_smaller.png]<br /><br />God created man in his own image. Yet Adam and Eve are shown with a belly button in every depiction. Does this imply that the painters were not painting reality ? If they did, that would mean god has a belly button! What did he use it for ? Storing his mana ?<br /><br />Also, if the painters were in fact *not* painting reality, can we trust any paintings at all ?<br />I wonder...<br /><br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />I ponder about some of the more important aspects of life while I study for my exams, like this for example:<br /><a href="http://data.singularity.be/images/full/undated/why_do_adam_and_eve_have_belly_buttons_smaller.png"><img src="http://data.singularity.be/images/full/undated/why_do_adam_and_eve_have_belly_buttons_smaller.png"></a><br /><br />God created man in his own image.
