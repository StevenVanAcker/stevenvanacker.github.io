Yesterday I wrote some assembly programs to do halfstep, fullstep and wavedrive control of a steppermotor, but the program just ran continuously in 1 direction. That's of course not so cool.<br /><br />What I want is to tell the PIC how many steps it should make in a certain direction, and then it should do so. This means I need to send commands to it once it's running (i.e. interactively). The most likely way good way to do this, is by using the RS232 functionality (serial line).<br /><br />Here is some example code on how to use a serial line with a PIC:<br />http://piccourses.50megs.com/code/codesamples.htm#rs232sendback<br /><br />
