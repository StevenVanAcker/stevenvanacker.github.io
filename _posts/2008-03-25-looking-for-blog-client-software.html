I am in need of a blog client that works together with blogger.com. The web interface could be called nice (I like how it saves a draft of my post every so often), but it lacks some fundamental features. For example, I would like to include images in my blogposts. On drupal, I could use filters to link my blog to a gallery2-style image album. There is no such plugin on Blogger. And that is why I am looking at blog clients.<br /><br />If I can find a blogclient that works with blogger (which uses Atom API), I would like it to have the following features:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Allow me to login to Blogger. Apparently, this is not that evident because the only Blogger-capable client that is in the Ubuntu repositories, Drivel, believes that the username I have on blogger is illegal because it has a '+' sign in it.</li><br /><li>It should have the option for user-contributed modules or plugins, so people can extend the client. Or alternatively, it should be written in a user-friendly programming language like python so I can try to extend it myself (and submit the patch to the interweb of course)</li><br /><li>It should allow me to work offline. This is a must, because my internet connection is very flaky at this point in time</li><br /><li>Preferably, it should allow me to import and export blogger posts so I can backup all my posts and restore them in case they need restoring. It would also provide a way for people moving from other blog software to migrate to Blogger by just importing all their posts.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Now there, thats not too much to ask is it ?<br /><br /><b>[Update]</b><br />I found a python blog client called <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/firedrop2/">Firedrop2</a>, but it doesn't seem to support Blogger.<br />I installed python-gdata again to see if I could hack something together. I ran into the same problems with python-gdata and python-elementtree. There is <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-gdata/+bug/138349">bug report</a> that describes my problem and postulates <a href="http://launchpadlibrarian.net/10259060/python-gdata_1.0-1ubuntu1.debdiff">a solution</a>. Oddly enough, this fix has not been applied to the ubuntu package yet, although it has existed for some time.<br /><br /><b>[Update]</b><br />The python-gdata package is so obviously broken, that I don't understand that noone is paying attention to it. I've posted a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-gdata/+bug/206872">bugreport to raise the severity of the previously reported bug</a>. The result will probably be a "fixed in the next version" reply, which would sortof work for me since the next release of Ubuntu is about a month away.
