Sidney Sussex College is where we stay. <br /><br />[G2:11921]<br />[G2:11926]<br /><br />Here are some pictures of my room<br /><br />[G2:11929]<br />[G2:11932]<br />[G2:11935]<br />[G2:11938]<br />[G2:11941]<br />[G2:11944]<br /><br />Notice the piano! If I could play it I would be very happy with that :)<br />Someone named Sutton was kind enough to let me use their room for my short stay, thank you for that.<br /><br />Random hot girl:<br />[G2:11947]<br /><br />I'm not sure I would have killed to get a room like this back in Belgium, but I would seriously consider doing it...
