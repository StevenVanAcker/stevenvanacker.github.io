After I noticed I was out of breath much more than usual and that my lungs hurt with every breath, I decided to finally go see a doctor today.<br /><br />It appears that some time ago, I had a lung infection which caused quite some damage in my lungs. The infection is now gone, but the mess it left behind is still there. The lower third of both lungs is filled with (I hope nuclear) waste, which reduces my lungcapacity quite a lot.<br /><br />I have an appointment tomorrow to have scans taken of my lungs. In the meantime, I have to take all sorts of medication, and stay away from large crowds for some reason.<br /><br />
