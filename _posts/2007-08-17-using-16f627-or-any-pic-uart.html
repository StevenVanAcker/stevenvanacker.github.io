<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />Last night, I have successfully used the PIC in my own circuit. Blinking some leds is the equivalent of a "hello world" program. Now it's time to do something more interactive.<br /><br />Instead of jumping in the deep water straight away, I'll just make a LED blinker that is interactive. By writing a byte to the PIC, I can drive 8 bits.<br /><br />First things first though: I need to learn about how the UART is used on the PIC.<br /><br />I've read the first paragraphes on http://www.rentron.com/Myke7.htm and I'm finding it very interesting. Most pages I find concerning PIC are either way over my head (hundreds of lines of assembler) or just contain links to other places.<br />I'm glad there is also some information for newbies on the web :)<br /><br />[Update]<br />After reading most of the site mentioned above, I know this is not what I need. Instead of using the UART, the site talks about bit banging, which is actually reading out the individual bits sent over the serial line...<br /><br />Next link: http://www.epanorama.net/links/microprocessor.html#pic<br /><br />[Update]<br />http://www.avitresearch.co.uk/USBTTL/tutorial.htm<br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />Last night, I have successfully used the PIC in my own circuit.
