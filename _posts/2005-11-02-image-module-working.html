It seems like the image module is working. It should be noted that Debian uses Drupal 4.5.5 (at this time) and thus you need 4.5.x modules from the drupal site.<br /><br />The module seems to require a lot of configuring which is a bad thing imho.<br />It has lots of settings and they are not structured in categories. This makes it hard to get an overview about what is important and what isn't, when first setting up the image module.<br /><br />I hope to be able to upload some pictures soon. When this works, I will start migrating all my old image galleries to drupal (all 3GB of them)<br /><br />For now, its time for bed :)
