The counter the problem of the burning wood, I bought a role of insulation material that is placed behind heaters to reflect heat and save energy.<br />[G2:11816]<br /><br />Cutting the material is NOT done like this (as I found out the hard way)<br />[G2:11832]<br />Because the styrofoam on that side will break in tiny pieces and the reflective side will rip.<br /><br />Instead, softly cut into the reflective side and break the styrofoam when everything is cut<br />[G2:11835]<br /><br />After everything was cut, the insulation fit perfectly<br />[G2:11841][G2:11844]<br /><br />And the insulation even works !<br />[G2:11847]<br /><br />The heat is definitely reflected better and no wood burns (except maybe those small pieces that are exposed between the cut material)<br /><br />Here's an interesting factoid though: the backside of the insulation material is made of styrofoam, which is expanded polystyrene. The very thing I want to melt with the oven ;)
