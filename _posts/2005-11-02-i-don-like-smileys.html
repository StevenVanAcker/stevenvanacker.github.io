Not that I'm not grateful for the module, but I don't like the images. Way too small. Someone import the MSN smileys or something :)<br /><br />It would also be nice if you could select a smileys-set to use. That way I could select the right smileys for each holiday, like halloween ;)<br /><br />Maybe if I have lots of time, I can look into this
