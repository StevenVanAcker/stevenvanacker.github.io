For the past couple of days, I've been playing with my laptop, GSM and bluetooth.<br /><br />I managed to send files from my laptop to my GSM, use my GSM as a modem and send SMS messages using my laptop.<br />All I need to do now, is document how I did all this :)<br /><br />But since I used stuff already available in ubuntu, it shouldn't be hard to reproduce.<br />Maybe tomorrow...
