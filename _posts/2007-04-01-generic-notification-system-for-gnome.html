So, yesterday I found out that my harddisk is about to crash. That's probably the reason why I couldn't get my bazaar-ng autocommit script to work like it should (it kept complaining about IO and CRC errors)<br /><br />To avoid problems like this on my laptop, I want to be informed of any event that interests me. Something that would watch logfiles and pop up a notification when something interesting happens, would be very welcome. <br /><br />At work I was running KDE before a Debian upgrade decided that KDE was not good enough for me and installed GNOME over it. Under KDE, I found an applet called <a href='http://metamonitor.sourceforge.net/'>MetaMonitor</a> which watches any file for changes, and then pops up a notification. I used it for some time but never tried to found out how to start it when KDE starts. So eventually, after some reboot, it didn't come back and I didn't notice.<br /><br />Even before I found MetaMonitor, I was playing around with perl scripts that use QT bindings, and even the <a href='http://developer.kde.org/documentation/other/dcop.html'>DCOP protocol</a>. The DCOP protocol allows you to interact with the desktop environment through the commandline. You can pop up messages and all that, it's really something.<br /><br />But since I now use GNOME, I would love to find a similar functionality. As far as I know, GNOME doesn't have something like DCOP. In fact, Ubuntu repositories (universe and multiverse) don't have a GNOME panel that can watch a syslog file. This is really a shame.<br /><br />I found a program called <a href='http://bandsaw.sourceforge.net/'>"Band Saw"</a> which sits in the taskbar and reports interesting syslog events. Unfortunately, it doesn't come in an Ubuntu package. But I guess that's ok, I can learn how to make those (and I assume it's not much different than building Debian packages).<br /><br />Band Saw is written in Python, which is also a good thing, since I wanted to learn python anyway ;)<br />Who knows, maybe I'll make some contributions to this project.<br /><br />[Update]<br />The Debian Administration website has an article about desktop notifications, which may give some pointers. I'll read it later<br /><br />http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/407
