I started looking at the mainboards with builtin videocard, but then I noticed none of them have more than 4 SATA ports. And I need atleast 5, preferably 6 (5 for the RAID and 1 for the /)<br /><br />Looking at the SATA ports, there are 2 with 8 ports, 2 with 6 and 1 with 5.<br />Both mainboards with 8 ports don't actually have 8 ports but only 4, I was wrong :(<br /><br />The choice is between these motherboards:<br />Asus A8N32-SLI Deluxe<br />MSI K8N-Diamond-54G<br />MSI K8N Diamond Plus<br />
