[G2:11002]<br /><br />I was playing with these trying to think of something that I could use to fortify the wires of my UTP cables, the ones I want to use to connect to my K8000. And then I suddenly realised I was holding the solution in my hands :)<br /><br />So after burning off the plastic (don't try this at home kids), I was left with a couple metal wires that were strong enough for my purpose.<br /><br />I melted off the plastic with the soldering stick the last time, it much less dangerous and the wires aren't scorched :P
