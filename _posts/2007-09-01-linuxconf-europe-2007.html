It's 5.45am and I'm about ready to depart to Cambridge UK where <a href='http://www.linuxconf.eu/'>LinuxConf.eu 2007</a> starts tomorrow morning. If everything goes as planned, we should arrive in Cambridge around mid-day today. My bus is set to depart at about 7am to the trainstation. From there, I take the train to Brussels-south where the EuroStar train takes us to London Waterloo (departure 8.59, half hour checkin time). Then a metro to London King's Cross and from there a train to Cambridge.<br /><br />Let's hope all of this makes sense when we're underway...<br /><br />On a sidenote, I'm curious to see whether or not Belgium will still be here when I get back on september 5th, or whether it will have been ripped in 2 by our politicians... :)
