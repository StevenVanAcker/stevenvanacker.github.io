Now that I've figured out how to use EncFS with libpam-encfs under Ubuntu, I decided to share this knowledge with the world. I've been working on a <a href='/node/6292'>"Useful Content"</a> page that provides details instructions on how to setup <a href='/node/6330'>EncFS with libpam-encfs on Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy)</a><br /><br />It's still under development, because I want to be very thourough. I installed Ubuntu desktop in <a href='http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/'>VMWare Workstation</a> and create snapshots as I move along. Every step I take is documented (that's the way I like to document things). Wrong steps are erased by reverting to the previous snapshot.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, I might provide a VMWare image with Ubuntu installed and EncFS+libpam-encfs setup correctly, for usage in the free <a href='http://www.vmware.com/products/player/'>VMWare Player</a>
