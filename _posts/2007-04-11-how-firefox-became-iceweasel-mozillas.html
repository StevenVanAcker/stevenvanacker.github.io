Some time ago, Debian renamed it's firefox packages to "iceweasel", but I never looked into the why of this.<br />Now while I was trying to find information on using Evolution together with Karm, I ran into <a href="http://djst.org/blog/2006/10/12/replace-evolution-with-thunderbird-in-ubuntu/">this article</a> claiming that Ubuntu's users prefer Thunderbird over Evolution (the standard mailclient in Ubuntu) and that Ubuntu should switch to Thunderbird.<br /><br />Thunderbird is Mozilla's mail client by the way...<br /><br />A reader posted this comment:<br /><pre><br />Mario Says<br /><br />After all the copyright trouble Mozilla has caused with Firefox for Debian & Ubuntu, <br />I donâ€™t expect a single Mozilla application to make it into a default choice on this or any similar distro.<br /></pre><br /><br />This caused me to look into the copyright issue a bit further:<br /><br />http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3634591<br />http://enterprise.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/09/1434251&tid=41<br /><br />It seems Mozilla has a trademarked logo for firefox, and wants this logo included with all versions of firefox. Debian considers the logo to be non-free (because it's trademarked and thus not free for use) and didn't want to include it.<br />Mozilla didn't move an inch, so Debian renamed it's firefox packages to iceweasel.<br /><br />Does anyone else see a stupid dispute in this ? Isn't the opensource community about sharing code for free use ?<br />When did the lawyers take over ? <br /><br />I consider this a big screwup for Mozilla. I've never liked the firefox/thunderbird hype. Finally I have a reason to boycott them.
