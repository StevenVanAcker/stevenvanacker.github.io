<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />The reinstallation of victoria was successful. 2 of the 4 virtual machines on it were converted and started without much trouble. The 3rd however was very troublesome. The VMWare snapshot would not load in virtualbox and I feared I had damaged the (original) disk by trying to boot from it. After a lot of fiddling I managed to dump the disk with all snapshots merged, converted it back to vmware format and loaded it in virtualbox.<br /><br />The final virtual machine I resurrected was the games machine which hosts 4 wargames: vortex, semtex, drifter and krypton.<br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />The reinstallation of victoria was successful. 2 of the 4 virtual machines on it were converted and started without much trouble.
