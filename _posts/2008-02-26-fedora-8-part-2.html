Someone mentioned that the "Core" part in "Fedora Core" was dropped a long time ago. That's good, because I have no idea what it was doing there anyway.<br /><br />After yesterdays disaster trying to install Fedora 8 (F8), I gave up onn qemu and switched to <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">Virtualbox</a>. It installed without problems.<br /><br />I then looked into KickStart to automate the installation process (because I'm lazy and a good system administrator). KickStart is pretty easy to setup: everything can be done over network.<br /><br />Now I have automated the installation process. It's time to look into making packages for Fedora and see if I can create a nice server template without too much effort.
