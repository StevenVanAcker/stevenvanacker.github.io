I reassembled my frame last saturday, but couldn't upload the pictures untill now because the webserver was down :(<br /><br />[G2:11554]<br /><br />Notice how the frame is bent a little on the left side. I have no idea why that is, but I hope it won't cause any trouble.<br /><br />[Update 20070727]<br />crashmann on the <a href='http://www.tk560.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=4386'>TK560 forums</a> recognizes this as "barrel distortion". It means my frame is not bent after all :)
