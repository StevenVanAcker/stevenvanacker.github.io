I brought up my old 19 inch screen from the basement and hooked it up to my laptop. I remember how I had my svideo working in Windows on my old laptop and I wanted to see how easy it was in Linux.<br /><br />As it happens, it is extremely easy.<br />Debian has a package called fglrx-control which is a nice GUI-tool to set dualhead and whatnot.<br />Of course, you need the fglrx driver loaded for that.<br /><br />This <a href='http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65276'>post</a> on the Gentoo forums can be of some help.<br />Debian doesn't give us an fglrxconfig tool, but has renamed it to aticonfig.<br />running it like this:<br /><pre><br />aticonfig --initial=dual-head<br /></pre><br /><br />will get you a basic dualhead config. restarting X then lets the magic happen! :)
