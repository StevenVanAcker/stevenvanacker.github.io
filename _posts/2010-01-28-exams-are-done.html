<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />I only had 1 exam, but at least its over and I think it went well. The last couple weeks I've finished GTA4 on my PS3 and did some work on my thesis. I finished a buttugly version of Conway's game of life using dirty pointer arithmatic tricks.<br /><br />The idea was to make spaghetti code, just so I could have a testcase for my thesis :)<br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />I only had 1 exam, but at least its over and I think it went well.
