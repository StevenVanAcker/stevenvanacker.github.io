After stripping both main gateways at work a couple weeks ago, I ripped all the hardware from them and assembled a nice desktop machine. I installed Ubuntu on it and everything was great. Birds were singing, the sun was shining and also, I had ice-cream!<br /><br />Tristan wanted to install this game he bought through eBay called Championship Manager (a football manager game) and for that, I needed Windows. After resizing the (9GB SCSI) harddisk to have some free space for Windows, I set out to look for a Windows 98SE CD. The original Windows 98SE CD I had was eaten by my old computer after it elegantly EXPLODED in the CDROM-drive. (Really, we still laugh about how the Windows CD crashed itself even before it was installed).<br /><br />So there I am, on the interweb. My good friend google soon located a Windows98SE ISO, which I downloaded of course. After the terribly slow CD-RW burning is done, I discover that the CD is in fact a copy of a Mexican Windows 98SE.<br /><br />Well, it couldn't be that bad, could it ? Things like "Microsoft Windows" are translated to the same thing in Spanish. "No" and "Si" are also quite understandable. Even things like "Continuar", "Instalar" and other friends are interpretable. However, I must have made a wrong turn somewhere because after rebooting, it appeared my Ubuntu was totally gone.<br />To make matters worse, the game wouldn't run under Windows 98SE (Even a multicultural version like mine! At least the errors were in English that time.)<br /><br />I thought Windows XP would run on my hardware like a fat pig up a hill on a burning summer-day, but it's quite allright.<br />The only thing I miss in this Windows, is a decent movieplayer. I just plain don't like MS Mediaplayer.<br />So I download the player I've always trusted: BSplayer.<br />Installation goes as I expected, except that after I agree to the license, this pops up: "To use BSplayer for free and support our future development you must keep Save! software on your PC".<br /><br />What. The. Hell.<br /><br />"You can remove Save! from your computer at any time in the "Add or Remove Programs" section of the Control Panel. To uninstall Save!, you must also uninstall BSplayer."<br /><br />Et tu, Brute ? BSplayer has succombed to the adware bussiness ??<br /><br />So sad :( The only good mediaplayer out on the internet seems to have beefed itself up with bloat- and adware. Beefcake!<br /><br />Dear Mr. BSpayer author, you have lost all my respect. Not only will I not install your excellent player with the added bloatware and adware cruft, I will find myself a mediaplayer that does all the same things AND without the cruft.<br />My PC is not a place where you can dump your trash and make money of it. kthx.<br />
