My projection to run 25 laps (10km) yesterday, was a bit optimistic.<br />I only managed o do 13 (5.2km).<br /><br />In my defense, my right leg hurt from the start, I had eaten alot, it was very stormy and I was getting a huge blister smack in the middle of my left foot.<br />But I think the biggest factor is that I was running alone. It made time pass a lot more slowly.<br /><br />That sounds like a bunch of excuses to me :)<br />I should have tried harder.
