I'm completely engulfed in this Windows/ISA/Powershell business these days andn thats not good.<br />Out of hard experience, I have learned that after any significant project lies a very deep and black hole. I don't want to fall in one of those things again.<br /><br />So, Instead of going forward and pushing the project faster and faster, I will slow down and start concentrating on other things again.<br /><br />First thing on the list is moving my www.singularity.be URL away from my old blog and pointing it towards blogspot. A lot of things will break because I never could be bothered with keeping my blog apart from the rest of my webspace. So, pictures will fail, aswell as the Dilbert comic.<br /><br />But I'll fix all that soon.
