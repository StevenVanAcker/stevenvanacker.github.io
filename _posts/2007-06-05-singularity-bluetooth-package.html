2 Days ago, I started working on the <a href='/node/6384'>Phase 6 guide</a> entitled "Communicating with GSM (Siemens S65) over Bluetooth to do filesharing, sending/receiving SMS and dialup networking".<br /><br />I have most things I want, working and documented. But of course that's not enough. Today I've started working on the Ubuntu package that will configure everything for me.<br /><br />For reference (I hate having to pick up manuals again), the correct repository line to go into /etc/apt/sources.list is <br /><pre><br />deb http://www.singularity.be ubuntu/<br /></pre><br /><br />I will split up the functionality of Phase 6 in 2 packages: singularity-bluetooth and singularity-dialup.<br /><br />Singularity-bluetooth will contain the dependencies needed to work with bluetooth: gnome-vfs-obexftp, bluez-gnome, obexpushd, gnome-bluetooth, gnome-phone-manager and bluez-utils.<br />On installation, the postinst script will scan for all bluetooth devices in range and prompt me to select one. Then, it will generate a link in the "Places" menu under Gnome (an obex://[00:11:22:33:44:55]/ link) and my /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf configuration file. It should also make sure that obexpushd is automatically started.<br /><br />Singularity-dialup will configure the dialup connection for the KULeuven network, and set it to use /dev/rfcomm0 (my GSM over bluetooth). The package is separated from singularity-bluetooth, because I don't expect it will be as useful to other people as the singularity-bluetooth package.<br /><br />One more thing I will create, is a singularity-ludit-printers package, which will configure all the printers LUDIT has, in my Ubuntu. That should shave some valuable seconds from my laptop installation procedure ;)<br /><br />[2 hours later]<br />I now have the singularity-bluetooth package ready. As announced, it will create /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf and add the bluetooth device under "Places" by adding an entry to ~/.gtk-bookmarks<br /><br />It also adds a configfile to /etc/X11/Xsession.d to start obexpushd when the user logs in. Arbitrarily, I chose ~/obexpushd_received as the target directory for OBEX uploads from the GSM.<br /><br />I'm reinstalling Ubuntu now to test this package on a clean system.
