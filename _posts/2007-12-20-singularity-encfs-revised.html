So, I've decided to give my laptop an overhaul and upgrade to Ubuntu Gutsy.<br /><br />Instead of using FUSE with EncFS, I'm going for dm-crypt this time. A guide on how to do this can be found here:<br />http://pupeno.com/2007/06/10/encrypted-home-ubuntu/<br /><br />In good singularity tradition, I've created a new Ubuntu repository for Gutsy, which I will use when reinstalling my laptop for real.<br />This repository kan be found under http://www.singularity.be/gutsy/<br /><br />After installing singularity-encfs (the name didn't change, it's still an encrypted filesystem), set a password on the root account and logout the regular user. Then login as root and execute <br /><br /><pre><br />singularity-encfs <username> <partition><br /></pre><br /><br />In my QEMU situation, I usually run <br /><pre><br />singularity-encfs guest /dev/sda2<br /></pre>
