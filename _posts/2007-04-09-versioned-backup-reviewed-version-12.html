I'm not happy with the versioned backup phase I have now. The versioned directories idea is a good one: I don't have to be too careful about changing files or even deleting them. The files are versioned so I can always revert to some previous version.<br /><br />What I'm not happy about is the way I plan to do backup. Why should I just backup the versioned directories and not the rest ? If it's on my laptop, it's probably important data so it should be backed up aswell.<br /><br />This brings me to the point that I want to backup my entire laptop. Or well, the partitions that I have Ubuntu on anyway.<br />I'm not sure yet about Windows, since that partition will not be mounted all the time...<br /><br />So the "versioned backup" phase should probably be split in 2: "versioned data" and "backup".<br /><br />The backup should be incremental and it should work over a flaky network since I don't plan to be online all the time.<br />My desktop machine on the other hand, will be on the wired network permanently. It will also have a central backup account on the Tivoli Storage we use at work. So, I just need to mirror my laptop to my desktop, and the data should be safe. <br /><br />Someone mentioned <a href='http://www.fluffy.co.uk/boxbackup/'>boxbackup</a> to me as a good way of making backups. Unfortunately, it does not have Ubuntu packages :(<br /><br /><a href='http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/HomePage'>sbackup</a> however, is supported by Ubuntu and comes with a GNOME GUI to configure it, and restore files.<br /><br />I've also looked at a way to keep track of projects I work on automatically. The favored candidate is <a href='http://gttr.sourceforge.net/'>GnoTime</a>, but it can't keep track of what I do automatically. It also looks like it can't be minimized to the taskbar. It looks like there is no alternative to <a href='http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ssk/kde/karm/karm.html'>Karm</a> and thus I will use it. I've thought about creating a GNOME karm clone myself, but that would get me sidetracked. The most important thing right now, is that I get my laptop up and running the way I want it.<br /><br />I will have to integrate the karm timesheets with my evolution calendar system, but that's not for now.
