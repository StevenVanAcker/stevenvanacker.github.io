Ok, this has been the worst monday in the history of mondays.<br />I'm glad the day is over and I'm still alive.<br /><br />Time to think about some fun stuff.<br />I finished the quest for a mainboard, researching all socket 939 mainboards that are listed on the snogard site. It would be lovely if someone designed some kind of protocol that described a piece of hardware in generic terms, for easy comparison. If all manufacturers put definitions of all their hardware online, you could do queries like: I want to see all mainboards with 4 SATA2 connectors, firewire, onboard video and a DVI connector.<br /><br />Anyways, after all the research I've still not found a mainboard I want to buy (actually, I'm sick of looking at mainboard specs for the moment and will revisit this topic later)<br />I have however been thinking about usecases for my new multimedia center.<br /><br />The server should serve the following functions:<br /><ul><br /><li>storage server</li><br /><li>internet gateway</li><br /><li>TV</li><br /><li>TV recorder</li><br /><li>Movie/DVD player</li><br /><li>radio</li><br /><li>Music/CD player</li><br /><li>Videogame console</li><br /><li>control center for lots of stuff like lights, heating, ... and burglar alarm</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><br />
