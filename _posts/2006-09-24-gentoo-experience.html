Since people are always nagging that gentoo is so great, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />First things first. I went to <a href='http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/index.xml?catid=install#doc_chap2'>the installation instructions</a> and went for <a href='http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-quickinstall.xml'>the quick install guide</a><br /><br />Here they tell me I have 2 options: the minimal install CD or the live CD. The minimal CD fetches everything over network but is the recommended approach. The Live CD is my favorite however, since I won't have to waste much bandwidth then.<br /><br />So I install the <a href='ftp://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo/releases/x86/current/livecd/'>Live CD</a>. After doing some laundry and taking 3 boxes of glass to the glass-container, the download is in.<br /><br />I boot it in vmware (of course I won't allow gentoo to trash any real system). I'm given a simple bootmenu, in which I select "gentoo-nofb". I don't like framebuffer. It's slow and useless in my opinion. All I want is text while I install things. It boots up nicely. To my surprise, it starts configuring OpenGL and gives me a Gnome desktop. So far for the text-only install. There is an icon "Install" which I doubleclick. A nice graphical installation application pops up and starts asking questions (17!). One of the questions being "Stage 3 tarball URI". I consult the documentation icon on the desktop, which takes me to <a href='http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/installer/faq.xml'>the gentoo installer FAQ</a>.<br /><br />Not to my surprise, I can't find any useful information on that page. I do find things like this:<br /><br /><pre><br />Q: Where can I find more information about the installer? <br />A: On the project pages. Currently, there is no documentation. <br />You can either read the source or ask in #gentoo-installer. If <br />you ask any questions covered by this FAQ, you will most likely be ignored.<br /></pre><br /><br />and my favorite:<br /><br /><pre><br />Q: Gentoo is too hard to install and I feel like whining. <br />A: Please see /dev/null.<br /></pre><br /><br />I can see it now: gentoo is probably written by the kind of linux-users I've come to hate.<br /><br />After looking for "stage3" on the entire CD (and not finding anything), I resort to the minimal install CD.<br /><br />This time (again booting with gentoo-nofb), it drops me into a shell. It appears I can skip most of the instructions in the guide since my private network uses DHCP.<br /><br />The next installation step I need my attention for is... partitioning the disk.<br />What is this, did the 80's invade my vmware ?<br /><br />Luckily, it appears the botched installer from the LiveCD already created some partitions for me (even when it couldn't continue the installation because I didn't have a stage3 tarball). Next! "create the filesystems and activate swap". I start hearing YMCA in the background.<br /><br />The next step would be setting time and date, but I couldn't care less about that since it's vmware. <br /><br />The stage3 tarball is 112 MB in size. Something tells me this shouldn't be a problem to put on the Live CD...<br />While I wait for the download to finish, I put some gas in my car and recharge the battery...<br /><br />Now the portage tarball needs to be downloaded, which is 31MB in size.<br /><br />Setting the timezone, hostname, etc...<br /><br />Now for the first gentoo command ! "emerge gentoo-sources"<br /><br />Which seems to download a kernel (another 40MB)...<br /><br />[update: 4th october 2006]<br />I stopped the virtual machine gentoo was on. Basically I got tired of it. Maybe when I have more time, I'll continue
