Using a combination of the Drupal xmlrpc.php functionality and the Blogger GData API, I was able to slam together some python code to migrate my old blog to this new one. However, 2 problems remain:<br /><ul><li>some blog posts can not be entered automagically because of an error 400: bad request. I'll have to add those manually.</li><li>I seem to be limited to about 50 posts per day using the automated process. <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42578">http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42578</a></li></ul><p></p>
