My mistake ! When testing out <a href='https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn'>Ubuntu Feisty Fawn</a>, I accidently downloaded an old version of the CD image. I downloaded Herd-5 instead of the Beta release which can be found here: http://www.ubuntu.com/news/Ubuntu704Beta<br /><br />Where herd-5 crashed with a kernel panic at boot, the beta release carries on happily and brings me to the login screen. From there, it looks like plain old Ubuntu.<br /><br />I've tested <a href='http://www.singularity.be/ubuntu'>my packages</a> in Feisty, and they work perfectly !<br /><br />Evolution works too, aswell as beagle.<br /><br />When beagle is installed, it can be found under "Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Search", not "Places &gt; Search Files". Although I think it should be the latter :/<br /><br />Beagle can also be started by a keyboard shortcut (see beagle preferences in the Search menu)
