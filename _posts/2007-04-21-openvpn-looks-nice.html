<a href='http://openvpn.net/'>OpenVPN</a> is SSL-VPN software that can do layer2/layer3 tunneling over a single udp/tcp port. I'm impressed.<br /><br />In addition, Ubuntu has a plugin for it's vpnc client, so that an OpenVPN client would integrate nicely.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like, it the lengthy configuration cycle: creating a CA, creating keys, configuring this configuring that. And I didn't get to the actual configuration file yet!<br /><br />There is an #openvpn channel on freenode where they tolerated my rant. So I'm impressed with their attitude aswell. I think it's well worth the effort to dig into OpenVPN.
