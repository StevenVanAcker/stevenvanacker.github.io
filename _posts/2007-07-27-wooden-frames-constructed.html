I finished building 2 wooden frames to hold the plastic. Pictures can be found here:<br />[G2:11574]<br /><br />A couple of things to note:<br /><br />First, don't believe anything coming from a hardwarestore. Well, maybe not anything, but still it's a good idea to doublecheck it.<br />As you can see on this picture [G2:11592], the width of my planks is not 36 but 35mm. <br /><br />Also, it doesn't look like any of the planks I bought was straight. I didn't notice it at the store because all 10 were tied well together. So keep that in mind... <br /><br />This is what my frames look like in the vacuform rack<br />[G2:11613]
