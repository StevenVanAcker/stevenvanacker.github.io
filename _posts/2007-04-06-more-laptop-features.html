Here are some more features I want on my laptop:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Dual screen for programming and presentations and the like.</li><br /><li>Disable the annoying touchpad sensitivity. I don't want to click on anything or select anything when I tap my touchpad too hard.</li><br /><li>3D support. I have an ATI X300 graphics card and plan to use it.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />I'm also thinking about making a virtual Ubuntu package that I can install on a fresh ubuntu installation, and that will install and configure all my laptop features automatically. in case I ever get a new laptop, I don't have to do all this work again.<br /><br />Also, my timesheet system (the one that keeps track of what projects I work on) should keep track of when I lock my desktop (when I'm on break) and it should work together with my local calendar system somehow.<br />Being able to synch with another calendar system would be a big plus (like MS Exchange for example, or whatever other expensive bloated closed-source system my employer plans to buy)
