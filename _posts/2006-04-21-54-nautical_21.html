We're past the firstmile stone now :) 10km straight.<br />An interesting sensation afterwards. My legs felt like they were not there at all.<br />I'm not sure I could have done much more than 25 laps, but I'm sure I'll get to 50 at some point.<br />Running 12 is now a breeze and in time, so will 25 be.
