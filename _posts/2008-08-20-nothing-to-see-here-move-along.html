<!-- StevensBlogSpotFilterThing<br />It's so sad to realise that I've wasted my time the last couple of days. I've played with putting Windows XP clients in a Samba domain to have roaming profiles and the ability for users to change their passwords through a familiar (ctrl-alt-del) interface in Windows. But the people I was looking at this for, don't want any kind of filesharing ;)<br /><br />Using scponly with WinSCP as an alternative for Samba has been another of those wastes of time. Not because it's a bad or unwanted idea, but because I actually wanted to deploy the chrooted version of scponly (scponlyc) instead. It turns out that setting up scponlyc becomes increasingly more and more complex as you're looking at the details. I don't mind setting up a chroot, but not with the script provided with the scponly package (since it starts adding users with useradd instead of adduser..., that's 2 undesireable things already). And I guess I can live with it that users see the entire chroot directory structure when they use scponly, although it probably is not necessary: I'm suren there's a way to hide all of those directories in files, only to make things even more complex. And then finally things went wrong went I used bindmounts and putting users into extra groups, to allow them to work on the same files together...<br /><br />All in vain, such a waste of time...<br />StevensBlogSpotFilterThing --><br />It's so sad to realise that I've wasted my time the last couple of days.
