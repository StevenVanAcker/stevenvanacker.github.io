The loadcarrying planks (carrying the big 102cm squares) of my frame did not fit together inside the metal L profile, so they had to be cut at a 45 degree angle.<br /><br />At first,. I tried using an electric mitre saw, but it did not have enough space underneath to cut the entire plank at once (9cm). The result was this:<br />[G2:11528]<br /><br />That wasn't good at all. After some advice from a friend of mine (Bob), I decided to buy a circular saw that could be tilted at a 45 degree angle. To lock down the planks, I used a bunch of scrap wood screwed to an old wooden work-table that the former tenants of our house left in the basement.<br /><br />[G2:11532]<br /><br />I didn't count on the guide-bar of the circular saw being so short, so had to fix the setup a bit and remount the scrap wood a little.<br /><br />[G2:11535][G2:11538]<br /><br />The result: A nicely cut 45 degree side.<br />[G2:11544]<br />The screwed up plank got fixed this way too:<br />[G2:11541]<br /><br />And now the supporting planks fit nicely together in the frame:<br />[G2:11547][G2:11550]<br /><br />I cut all the planks now, but didn't assemble the entire frame yet. Instead, I took everything apart and will assemble it in the basement. The livingroom (while it's a nice place to work) is not the right place to do this kind of stuff.<br /><br />All pictures:<br />[G2:11526]
