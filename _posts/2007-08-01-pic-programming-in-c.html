The PIC 16F627 that comes with the K8048 I bought earlier works like it should. I can program it from windows using sample code that comes with the PIC programmer board. But the PIC is not of much use if all I can do is pump sample programs on it.<br /><br />I was tempted to write programs in assembler, but after finding this article:<br />http://www.micahcarrick.com/v2/content/view/14/21/<br />I think I will just use C to do it. When I have a better grasp of how the PIC functions (I tried reading the datasheet, but it's real dry stuff), I can always do things in assembler.
