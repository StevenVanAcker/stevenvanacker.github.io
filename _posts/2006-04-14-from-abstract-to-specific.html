I'm sick of building web interfaces to do all kinds of administrative tasks (KULeuvenNet internal)<br />At this moment, I'm trying to work out a system that allows decentralised sysadmins to edit their DNS information using a secure support site.<br /><br />When people think of such an interface, they expect that it has a lot of functionality. A list with domains they can edit, with links to edit the SOA section. An overview of all zone entries. And then a lot of logic between the lot of it to make their life easier.<br /><br />Well yes, I could make a page where you have to jump between fields and then press "submit" to make a single entry. And I could do automatic checking of IP's and see if a hostname isn't already mentioned. I could automagically update the timestamp on each SOA section.<br /><br />But I'm lazy<br /><br />Instead of doing all the above, I will present the sysadmin with a single text box containing her raw zone information. It's up to the sysadmins to learn to edit it then.<br /><br />And since I'm lazy, I don't plan to implement this myself ofcourse.<br />On top of that, I want the interface to be very generic. Besides DNS, I also want to include firewall rules at a later stage. And maybe DHCP config too.<br /><br />The interface should be pretty simple. Users must be able to login (and logout!) preferably a system that can support shibboleth. Users must be presented with a page containing links to config-sections they can edit. They should only be able to edit those sections...<br />Furthermore, a record should be kept (version control system) of all changes. The software should allow grouping of users if possible. The config-sections should be easy to extract by a backend.<br /><br />If possible, the system should allow custom filters (like in drupal) that can sanity check the config-sections once they are saved. This would give direct feedback to the users.<br /><br />All of this should be configurable by the backend, not by a website (all our configuration is stored centrally and I don't like web-interfaces for administration)<br />The system should preferably be written in PHP and it should be simple and secure (KISS)<br /><br />So, on of the first things that pops into mind is a Wiki. The wiki should have a decent access control system. But besides that, most features are implicitely included in a wiki.<br /><br />I'm now looking at different wiki's (you wouldn't believe how many are out there!
