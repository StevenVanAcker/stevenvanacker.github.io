There was a discussion on the pulltheplug chat today about how sucky the security of <a href='http://www.rosiello.net'>Rosiello products</a> is. One thing let to the other and some <a href='http://www.rosiello.net/shirts/'>links to pictures</a> were pasted.<br /><br />Then, a first (to my knowledge) PTP Photoshop contest was launched, and I entered this picture:<br /><br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1017698|thumb=1|alt=6110_large.jpg]<br /><br />While I was editing this blog, I noticed an error in the changes I made to the img_assist module. It would not show all the pictures I wanted. I'm gonna look into it more closely and submit the changes to the drupal.org site again.<br />
