It is now 4PM<br /><br />I started the afternoon by picking up the wash-drying machine. Then I went shopping for a digital camera, but the prices are too high.<br />I cleared the snow from the windshield of my car and drove around a bit. I'm getting more comfortable driving around with a car on gasoline.<br /><br />I ended up at the insurance firm and asked about some stuff. I can open a saving account with 6% interest (under some terms), which sounds pretty cool. Adding theft insurance to our house would cost an extra 80 euro per year. And it seems I CAN get insurance for a car without having a drivers license. But since I probably won't get to drive around on my own any time soon, that's just an interesting fact and nothing exciting.<br /><br />Now I'm too tired to do anything. I'll have some tea and then do nothing at all :)<br />
