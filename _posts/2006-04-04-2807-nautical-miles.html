that's 5.2 kilometers or 13 laps. I was only going to do 7, maybe 8.<br />But I'm glad I pushed myself alot further.<br />If I keep it up like this, I can run the student marathon in october and finally EARN a t-shirt instead of getting one for free as compensation for computer and network support at the event.
