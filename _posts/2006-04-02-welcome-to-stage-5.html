There was someone I used to help with math. It's one of the things I like to do, because math is simple and straightforward. While I was explaining things, I realised that I have a weird view on the world. I can't remember how I used to view the world, or how other people view it. (I was going to write "how normal people view it", but then I realised that it would be really arrogant to assume I'm in any way special)<br /><br />Where others see numbers, I see patterns and trends. Where people see formulas, I see graphics. I have some kind of insight that I can't explain. I've been called a genius, but even if I would drop modesty, that would be overrated. I'd like to think I'm walking the fine line between geniality and insanity.<br /><br />There is no mathematical explanation for human interaction, maybe that's why I'm so bad at it.<br /><br />I've seen 5 stages in a friendship.<br /><dl><br /><dt>stage 1</dt><br /><dd>after the introduction, there's some kind of mutual discovery where you learn things about eachother and form the basis of a friendship</dd><br /><dt>stage 2</dt><br /><dd>a period where you have fun hanging around, talking about nothing, doing things together. This is the fun part</dd><br /><dt>stage 3</dt><br /><dd>contact diminishes for some reason or another. while I do my best to stay in contact, the answer is mostly "no time".</dd><br /><dt>stage 4</dt><br /><dd>after managing to get in contact again, there are some more talks like in stage 2, but much less natural. I usually try to understand why stage 3 happened, while the other side doesn't seem to want to do anything to improve relations.</dd><br /><dt>stage 5</dt><br /><dd>the final contact. this happens shortly after stage 4. all contact is lost and I'm basically ignored.</dd><br /></dl><br /><br />It's ironic that my friendships always follow this path, while I assume friendships can't be defined to have a path...<br /><br />I've recently lost a lot of friends. So much even that I believe I'm causing it in some way.<br />This has happened before, but I thought I found a solution, but I apparently didn't...<br />I'm drifting again with noone to fall back on<br /><br /><pre><br />By cover of Darkness<br />One Star lights<br />The others<br /><br />Drawn together<br />Stars enlight eachother<br />A dance of lights<br /><br />Slung out, cast away<br />Back to the Outer Rim<br />Light fades to Black<br /><br />The Deepest Star<br /><br />-- DeepStar, Stage 5<br /></pre><br /><br />I was at a birthdayparty of a good friend yesterday. She caused me to write<br /><pre><br />Friends, extensions of our soul, helping to carry the burden of shared thoughts,<br />standing shoulder to shoulder prepared and equipped to handle whatever comes<br />down the road of life, together.<br /></pre><br /><br />There were so many people I didn't know, I felt like an outsider. Instead of engaging the unknown, I chickened out and wondered why I was there.<br />I left without anyone noticing.<br /><br />I want to talk to her about it. Make sure she knows I enjoyed the time I was there. But I don't know how to do that.<br /><br />How do you talk to someone about things that rip you apart, without scaring her away ? Is it worth losing a friendship just to try ?<br /><br />I see no way out without damage. I need to take some distance without causing another stage 5.
