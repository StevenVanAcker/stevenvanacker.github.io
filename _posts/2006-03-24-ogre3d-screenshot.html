I finally have a screenshot of an ogre3d scene.<br />Since I'm currently only following the basic tutorials, its not much.<br />Still, its a start :)<br /><br />This image shows a ninja mesh with several light sources on it, throwing shadows on the floor.<br /><br />[img_assist|fid=1017737|thumb=1|alt=6195_large.png]<br />
