My 3D projects are getting way not enough attention.<br />I've looked at ogre3d once more today and finally found why it wouldn't work.<br /><br />I installed the Debian packages for ogre3d (libs, -dev and -docs) and tried to compile the SampleApp.cpp provided on the website. This of course didn't work because ExampleApplication.cpp and ExampleApplication.h are required, both nowhere to be found except in the sourcecode...<br />After installing even more files lige plugins.cfg and so on, It would finally DO something. It just didn't do much :( All I saw was a small black window asking me to select a renderer. And I couldn't select anything.<br /><br />Today I looked into plugins.cfg after a hint from google and made the plugins directory point to /usr/lib/OGRE<br /><br />Now at least it shows something :)<br />Just nothing in 3D yet...<br /><br />Screenshots soon ? I hope so
