I said in some earlier post that I don't use the singularity-versioning functionality very much. But that doesn't mean having different versions of my files is overkill.<br /><br />In my current setup, singularity-versioning automatically versions all the files in certain directories using bazaar-ng. Then I also have a singularity-backup-client package installed on the client, which provides a script called by singularity-backup-server on the backup server.<br /><br />I want to combine all of the above: I will drop singularity-versioning and use rdiff-backup in singularity-backup-client/server.<br /><br />Rdiff-backup can take a backup incrementally and store each difference in a separate file. So, I have backups of all my files AND I can go back several versions if I wish. No need to keep a local repository, everything is done on the server.<br /><br />[Update]<br />The first test to see what running rdiff-backup feels and looks like, failed with:<br /><pre>Warning: Local version 1.1.5 does not match remote version 1.1.14.</pre><br /><br />Apparently, this is <a href='http://bugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=420869'>a known issue</a> and won't be fixed at all.<br /><br />I guess this rules out having an older version of Ubuntu on my server, or even runinng Debian stable on it...<br /><br />[Update]<br />In my setup, the server initiates the backup and pulls it off the client. The problem with this approach is DHCP. My client (laptop) can get a new IP from time to time and the backup-server should be notified of that.<br />I'm thinking of either dynamic DNS, but I don't have access to the DNS server (well actually, I do, but I don't want to dirty it with my own concoctions), or letting the client connenct to the server from time to time to inform it of its IP address.<br />
